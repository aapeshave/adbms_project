At the level where it's loud enough for ME to hear, the headset creates a BAD echo for the other party on the phone, so half the time I have to turn it off and just use my straight cell phone.Another annoyance, although more minor, is that the ear pads always flip around when I take them off, so in order to put them on I have to use two hands to fiddle around and flip the pads so that they face my ears. And yes, the flashing blue light is annoying, especially if I forget to turn the headset off before I go to bed, but the positive side of it is they are easy to find at night in the car, like a lighthouse in the fog!I will say I have had them almost a year now and I have had no operation problems.

It would be nice if they came with a carrying case. As you have read, the blue light makes me feel self-conscious. I'm thinking of buying some model paint and paint over most of the light so it's not so obnoxious (Customer service told me there was no way to turn it off).Bluetooth access with my phone works ok with my phone (PCC-6700 from Sprint) only after I downloaded some software out there on the web to enable A2DP on my phone. Given that my phone didn't have A2DP to start with, I'm very happy to get these working at all. Connection is not perfect however. I ALWAYS have to reconnect the first time I turn on my headphones for the stereo capability; however the phone headset functionality works without reconnecting (I just turn on the phones and I'm good to go). Sometimes the volume isn't as loud as I would like. I noticed that if I'm listening to music, then I make a phone call with the headphones attached, then go back to listening to music I get the volume up to what I would consider an acceptable level (loud).I chalk these oddities up to the immaturity of the bluetooth protocol, not to the headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2007", "summary": "Phones good, Bluetooth bad"}

The sound quality, for such a small set, is actually quite decent. While I typically am not a fan of on-the-ear phones, these are quite comfortable and never give me any ear wear trouble.My primary use for these is listening music (via phone or computer), and they are great for that. They sync easily and have a really decent battery life (3 days at about 2-3 hours a day use). The few times I've used if them with my phone for calls, the volume and clarity of the mic was reported to be acceptable by the people on the other end.The only down sides to these headphones are twofold:1) Construction Quality: If you sit on these, kiss them goodbye. They are lightweight and they just don't feel like they'd stand up to much of a beating. That said, just be careful with 'em.2) BLINKING FREAKING LIGHT: This is the biggest \"bad\" thing about these headphones. On the right ear, the circle around the controls lights up blue or red as a user interface clue (ie: when turned on it will blink read 1, 2, or 3 times to indicate battery level.) However, when just on and in listen mode, it flashes this horrifically bright blue -- I wouldn't wear them on the train for fear of blinding everyone on my right side! There is a solution, however: a few expert dabs of black paint (a sharpie didn't work :/) and the blink is reduced to nearly gone. Leave a space open for it so you can still see the \"UI\" elements, but it covers most of it.Overall the headphones have quality sound, are easy to setup, and a joy to use.

So I can't use these headphones with my bluetooth mouse and keyboard. That's right -- when I move the mouse, the audio cuts out.Second, you can't use the microphone and the high-quality headphones at the same time.

I sent several e-mails about the device not working as expected, and they continuously told me to email Plantronics rather than accepting a return. Plantronics was less helpful, saying that \"the problems you are experiencing are just the limitations of Bluetooth technology.\" In other words, they figured the device works as advertised!If you are looking for a wireless headset for your computer, go with a RF one.
