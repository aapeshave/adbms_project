However, since it's a camera lens it should at least be able to focus in order to take a picture.  Came packaged nice, had all the parts, made of aluminum and it had a bit of &#34;white&#34; corrosion on it like aluminum gets so I had to use some steel wool to remove it before I gave it to the person it was intended.  Being a gift also compounded the disappointment.  Next is the return process so hopefully that will go better than the first part.  I may even just skip that part as the time and money to return it may not be worth the $15 cost in the first place.  Very much on the fence in regard to that which is part of buying online, the risk of having to jump through hoops to return it rather than walking into a store and resolving the problem somewhat immediately and in person.  One star for it getting to me, one star for appearance and packaging.  No stars for functionality if it doesn't work, right?If it did work I also think it would be very difficult to keep it steady to get the picture.  I read that in other reviews and once I had it in my hand and even though I couldn't get it to focus enough to result in a good picture, I could see enough that it was evident something this small and zooming 12x would make it a challenge.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2013", "summary": "It didn't focus"}

The type of music that I listen to are not hip/pop, rock or rap which has a lot of bass.  I do have the phone BT audio volume turned to the max and likewise fairly loud for the car audio volume (probably because the audio signal is weak).

On the other hand, I now use this BT unit with my home stereo system which has its own amplifier. If I lower the phone BT audio volume, it works okey.On a separate note, I had purchased this BT receiver trying to figure out why I couldn't get phone audio from my car speakers.

Here is a report on what those were, what other uses I discovered, and how Glass fared in regard to each use.A better action video camera?I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $50 bullet camera with better battery life, better image quality (because of the wide-angle lense) and better operability (because I see what it records and can pause it etc).The verdict: Glass fails in this category. The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger). I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure. This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs. The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.It does not fit under or over ski goggles, and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles (too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds).An in-vehicle or dashboard camera?A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great. Glass is promising, because it captures my field of view, including the rear view mirror, but it is not reliable and cannot record continuously. When plugged in, the battery life would be no issue, but there is currently no app that records continuously (and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out). Also, the display is always on when it records video, which is bothersome at night.With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds, but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.My verdict: I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software. Currently it is limited.A better run/ride tracker?I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order, and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.The verdict: Glass fails in this category, but my reasoning requires explanation, because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass. Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone, and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired. Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate. When I started a \"Run\" on Strava while walking the dog, it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on. I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.In addition to issue with GPS accuracy, I don't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat (or rain water!) to enter the device.A better headset?A resounding no here. The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear. Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable. The sound quality is moderate at best, and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions, to a point where I cannot understand the other party. I keep my Glass clean and protected, so I am not sure what causes the distortion. Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me. Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you can't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket. Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter. I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.A hands-free smart phone controller?Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature. If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively, you are being well-served by Glass. You will be alerted by and can read instant messages. and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.I don't seem to be able to create emails from scratch, only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts. I do see emails in my Gmail inbox, though. They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass. This is pretty cool.The verdict: Unfortunately, I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts, and I frankly don't get Hangouts. I cannot access emails on my company's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass, and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone, I only see 14 contacts on Glass. This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.A better navigation device?I really like the way navigation works. I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System. In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all, and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions. This works so much better on Glass.My verdict: Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product, in the car as well as on the bike or on foot (even though Google Maps lacks trail data). Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines, it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe. I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn, but I don't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.A better music streaming device?With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches, Glass offers yet another compelling use.My verdict: Exciting possibilities, but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds. The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is, well, mono only; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $85, and my ears aren't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway. They tend to hurt and fall out, and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass. Overall, I am somewhat indifferent about Glass' current usefulness as a music streaming device.Other uses?Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer. The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited (I just counted 35), which I find surprising, given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.My verdict: The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small. I am confident that this will change. Still, no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.A mature and well-tested device?I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out. Examples?*The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly. I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis. I just disabled this feature entirely.*The \"Ok Glass\" command stopped working on the 3rd day. I had to do a factory reset to get it back.*When I did a factory reset, it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again. Glass would just not get into pairing mode.*Currently, phone calls or navigation don't work while on a Wifi connection, even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5. There is no way to \"disable\" the wireless connection temporarily. You have to make Glass \"Forget\" the connection to make a call and then recreate it. The phone reports the Bluetooth profile \"Phone Audio\", not \"Headset\" as one would expect.*I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass. I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides. So far I added 5 contacts. When I want to make a phone call, I am presented with 14 contact choices, though, the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google. With half of them I have had no contact in years and I don't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.My overall verdict:The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future. But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline, comes with a high price tag, and that non-techie consumers will struggle with. The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month. It still works as a conversation-starter. If you expect anything more than that, you will be disappointed.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2014", "summary": "Charcoal paper weight"}

Everything went downhill though when I tried to charge it.After trying three different micro USB cables, I eventually got the case to start charging by shoving one of them as far into the port as possible with quite a bit of force.  If I even touched the cable after putting it in the port, it would stop charging my case.  Since this case's input is 500mAh, charging took approximately 7 hours, give or take an hour.  After a whole night of charging (might I add the LED's on this thing are as bright as the sun, be prepared to flip it over if it's charging in your bedroom at night), I plugged my phone into the case the next day with about 1/4 of my phone's battery left.  My case's LED indicator went from four LED's to just one in a little over an hour, and it added about 7% of battery life to my phone.  Between the extremely finicky charging cable port, and it's lack of being able to hold a charge, I had to return this product.I would have given it one star since it really doesn't hold a charge or even charge for that matter, but I decided to add another for the design of the case although the kickstand is extremely flimsy and half of the time won't even hold up my phone.

The battery on this case will do about a 70% charge, they make cases with bigger batteries but those are also bulky and heavy.

You can charge the case and battery at the same time by switching on the power for the case while it is plugged in, but ONLY do this with a 500mA charger!!

While I was mostly pleased with the case design (it's attractive, sleek, provides a snug fit for the phone, and is lightweight), the battery performance has been disappointing.  When I've attempted to charge the phone in the case overnight (with the case turned on), the phone is still not fully charged some 7 hours later.  When I've relied on the case to recharge the battery on the go, recharging not only takes hours, but the extended battery runs out of juice before the charge is complete.  Typically, I can only get to 70% charge of my Galaxy S4, even having charged the case to 100% (as indicated by 4 blue lights on the LED panel).  Since a couple reviews alluded to the PowerBear's lackluster performance, I'm sorry I failed to heed those warnings in purchasing the item.  I had hoped to avoid spending what the Mophie battery case currently costs, but as is often the case--we get what we pay for.

Pros: it protects well on the parts that it covers, it's super grippy, it looks cool, it doesn't have an offensive odor.  It also fits surprisingly well - even the tiny holes line up.  The graphics on the back are sharp, the Gameboy stuff is 3-D and looks really good.  Overall, nice quality.  The only downside:  like all cases of this type, the softness means that certain parts are a bit loose, like the left/right edges, and the thin part near the speaker/mic end.  That's just a tradeoff with the soft silicone.  If you just want need minimal protection from scratching the back/sides, and something to make the phone less slippery, this works great.  If you need serious protection, check out one of the hard cases.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2014", "summary": "Super deal for what it is"}

Upgraded from 1 star to 3 starsI retested it again..Source Power 14.4VThis time I used a 3' cable rather than the original 6' test cableUsing the 3' cable...The upper connection (which is labeled iPad) only produced 1.2A.BUT I was able to get 1.9A from the lower connection which was enough to charge an iPad Just barely enough to charge the iPad3... won't work with a 6' cable as the voltage drop is just that much more than the unit can handle and still produce enough power for an iPad3 Both units tested identically....I am not going to return them after all...but I will still look for the other models..", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2012", "summary": "Would barely charge an iPad3"}

Not only that but the clear part on top lights up a cute little blue light; very appealing.  It is small and very handy.

The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2012", "summary": "Works Fine, But It Died On ME"}

I did a little research and this is the cheapest 2 prong high output charger I could find.  I just needed something to charge my ipad in the car and this turned out to be much better than that.Lets start off with the basics.  This charger has two ports, only one is the high voltage one that will charge your ipad(i think its 2 amps or something).  You have to make sure that you plug your ipad into the high voltage one or it will charge veryyyyy slowly.  Of the two ports one is in the middle and one is on top of that.  It is the top one that is the high output.  There is a little sticker that tells you this on the actual device but you wouldn't know its there unless someone told you(look closely youll find it).  Note to manufacturer, make that sticker in white or something, its almost impossible to read in black.As a little bonus this charger has a blue led that lights up the clear plastic when its plugged in which is nice because a simple glance will tell you whether its connected or not.  Another little bonus is that if you plug your iphone into the high output socket it will charge the entire battery in about an hour!  That's A++ in my book, especially if you use the GPS a lot which drains the iphone pretty fast.Overall I am very happy with this item.  So much so that I ordered three more to replace all my chargers... Who knows what else will charge faster with this thing.

Then open the boom and release the button.  The headset will now stay in pairing mode for as long as you like.ObReview:  I had an H500 before and hated it for reasons that I won't go into here because this is an H700 review.  I finally tried the H700 and mostly loved it.  I have a few problems with noise when it's not line-of-sight to the phone.  A friend has had no end of trouble getting hers to pair with her Treo.  It's easy to accidentally mute (by holding both volume buttons at the same time), causing people to think it's broken.But all in all, I love it.  They completely nailed the user interface.  My typical way to use it is to have it turned off and in my pocket.  When I get a phone call and realize it's going to be a long one, I reach for the H700, open the boom and put it on.  It typically connects with my phone and picks up the call by the time I have it on my ear.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2008", "summary": "Here's how to fix the pairing problem"}

It looks stained like somebody's makeup was left on it and they didn't clean it off.The rubberized covering isn't really all that \"rubbery\" and mostly just a smooth surface. Also, its takes the jaws of life to pry off the covering! I tried to replace the screen protector on it and the indention on the left side of the case was big enough for my fingernail to pry it but i ended up using a little screwdriver to take it off from an opening on top of the phone while trying not to scratch or damage it. So if there was a separate rating for overall look. i'd give it 5 stars for the design only. The quality of the product is poor, and i hate to give it a bad rating, but the case i received does not look brand new at all.

Fortunately, I did have a 120-volt Nokia N97 charger in my laptop bag, and had a 12-volt to 120-volt converter for my netbook, so I was able to get by.  [Finding a Nokia N97 charger, with the almost proprietary USB style connector at Radio Shack or Walmart is not going to happen].When I returned from the trip, I ordered a \"no name\" aftermarket 12-volt charger for the phone.  It turned out to be unreliable.  That was a wasted $7.I went back to Amazon, and bought this official Nokia charger for about $10 more than the aftermarket chargers.  I was kicking myself for initially \"saving\" $10 for a no-name charger for my very expensive phone.  What if it had damaged the phone?  I had spent a lot of money for a very high end phone, and then risked killing it by using a $10 cheaper charger.  Where's the logic in that?  Why risk your $600 phone by using a $7 charger, when the official Nokia charger is just $10 more. D'oh!This charger works as it should.  It charges the phone quickly, doesn't do anything weird to the car radio, and doesn't get hot.  The peace of mind, knowing that it isn't likely to damage the phone, or start a fire in the car, is worth far more than the extra $10 cost.  I wouldn't know about doing a technical review of this charger.  Somewhere, I read that there's a microchip logic in the charger.  If so, that could have been the problem with the cheap charger. This one works very well, doing what it's supposed to do.  I didn't give it 5 stars because Nokia is almost certainly overcharging...(Get it? Overcharging?)for this item.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2010", "summary": "More Expensive, but Peace of Mind"}

My charger worked fine for about 2 months. Between regular usage on my Samsung Epic and letting people in the car with the same port plug in their phone, the charger no longer works properly. In the beginning, I could talk on the phone or have it in any position while charging. Over the 2 months the charger started getting more particular about what position it could be charged in. As of the review it only works with the phone in a horizontal position on my center console. The blue LED status light does let me know when it's charging or not, but this is small consolation when I have a near dead battery and a call comes in. From outside appearances the charger appears fine, but either the wiring near the phone port connector is weakened or the port connector itself is faulty. I have since tested other chargers on my phone and they work fine so it is not a phone or car power outlet problem. If I was stuck somewhere with a dead battery and the price was at or near $5 as it is here, I would buy this. So, other than for emergency or a cheap backup I would spring for something better.Pros- Price. You can't beat the at or near $5 price. Can leave charger plugged even when not in use.Cons- Poorly made. Cord is too short. Great in a pinch only. Will more than likely not function in a few monthsP.S. Another recommendation would be to only use your charger on your phone or the same model. Even though the ports are supposed to be universal, I believe it helped speed up my charger being finicky. Your friends and family may hate you for being \"stingy\" with your charger but at least it has a better chance of working for your phone later.

It seems to charge okay, but the length is the problem.  It has that spirral retracting cord, and if one  was to extend it as far as possible. it MIGHT be 6.5 feet long.  However, one could never use it that way because the thing pulls back into the coiled position that is not more than maybe two feet.  This makes it almost impossible to plug into your socket and do anything other than place the phone on your seat. While driving, the phone very easily slides off the seat and onto the floor when you make even an easy right turn.  Frustrating.  The main reason I bought this was because of the advertised length. I knew upfront from looking at the picture that it was probably all of not truly 6.5 feet, but this is ridiculous.  So, don't believe the thing is really longer than 2 feet, if that.Update, 3/8/13: After using this thing for a couple of days in my car, I find that the comments made by other reviewers about the defective connection of the charger cord to the phone is something that is occurring with mine as well. I find that I have to disconnect this thing several times before it actually makes a hot connection. So, this problem combined with my initial complaint about the lack of useable cord length, would rate a no-star grade.  DON'T but thing thing.
