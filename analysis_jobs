Binning Pattern
	Binning pattern is used for organizing metadata into price beans. These bins are:
	 <$2, <$5, <$10, <$15 and >$15.
	 There are three input splits for each bin. 
Partitioning Pattern - RatingWisePartitioning
	Used partitioning pattern for clusterning reviews into separate files as per rating. 
	Partioner is used.
Summarization Pattern - ReviewSummarization
	Used summarization pattern for calculating average, max and min rating for products. Used custom writable class for output. 
	File is used for pig joins.
Top Distinct Categories - TopDistictCetegories
	Used job chaining. First job gets distinct categories from metadata of products. Second job gives the top ten category results. Used TreeMap to sort keys and get top ten.
 Top Category Partititons - FindingTopRatedProducts
	Based on the top ten categories from the above job, we added these top categories into distrbuted cache from local file. Then partitioned metadata according the categories. 
	This output is later used in pig join, to find top 10 products in each category.
PIG 
	Get top ten products for each top category for faster retrieval from huge category parititons. 
	Used the data from summarization job and top category data to perform join. 
	Result is top rated products in each top rated category.
Simple Randon Sampling - 
	Created random data for sentimental analysis. 
Sentimental Analysis - 
	performed sentimental analysis on customer reviews on the sampled data from the above job. 
	IBM watson natural language understanding API provides various entities for judging the sentiments of a text. 
	The api analyses the text input based on keywords cache. It also outputs the emotion of sentiment. Finally calculating the sentiment score. 
Mahout Recommendation - 
	Mahout user based recommendation to search a user and get products recommended for him according to user similarity.
