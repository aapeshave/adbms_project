At the level where it's loud enough for ME to hear, the headset creates a BAD echo for the other party on the phone, so half the time I have to turn it off and just use my straight cell phone.Another annoyance, although more minor, is that the ear pads always flip around when I take them off, so in order to put them on I have to use two hands to fiddle around and flip the pads so that they face my ears. And yes, the flashing blue light is annoying, especially if I forget to turn the headset off before I go to bed, but the positive side of it is they are easy to find at night in the car, like a lighthouse in the fog!I will say I have had them almost a year now and I have had no operation problems.

Given that my phone didn't have A2DP to start with, I'm very happy to get these working at all. Connection is not perfect however. I ALWAYS have to reconnect the first time I turn on my headphones for the stereo capability; however the phone headset functionality works without reconnecting (I just turn on the phones and I'm good to go).

I noticed that if I'm listening to music, then I make a phone call with the headphones attached, then go back to listening to music I get the volume up to what I would consider an acceptable level (loud).I chalk these oddities up to the immaturity of the bluetooth protocol, not to the headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2007", "summary": "Phones good, Bluetooth bad"}

The sound quality, for such a small set, is actually quite decent. While I typically am not a fan of on-the-ear phones, these are quite comfortable and never give me any ear wear trouble.My primary use for these is listening music (via phone or computer), and they are great for that. They sync easily and have a really decent battery life (3 days at about 2-3 hours a day use). The few times I've used if them with my phone for calls, the volume and clarity of the mic was reported to be acceptable by the people on the other end.The only down sides to these headphones are twofold:1) Construction Quality: If you sit on these, kiss them goodbye. They are lightweight and they just don't feel like they'd stand up to much of a beating. That said, just be careful with 'em.2) BLINKING FREAKING LIGHT: This is the biggest \"bad\" thing about these headphones. On the right ear, the circle around the controls lights up blue or red as a user interface clue (ie: when turned on it will blink read 1, 2, or 3 times to indicate battery level.) However, when just on and in listen mode, it flashes this horrifically bright blue -- I wouldn't wear them on the train for fear of blinding everyone on my right side! There is a solution, however: a few expert dabs of black paint (a sharpie didn't work :/) and the blink is reduced to nearly gone. Leave a space open for it so you can still see the \"UI\" elements, but it covers most of it.Overall the headphones have quality sound, are easy to setup, and a joy to use.

I use a Cingular 3125 phone and 160Kb/s WMA audio (forget MP3).2) Flawless support of Bluetooth profiles for headset and stereo headphones. Very intutive operation.

Hands free sound quality is superb.4) Bluetooth doesn't drop out like the others. Strong reliable reception.5) Regular headphone style, adjustable, and very lightweight. You're preference may vary but the behind-the-neck style practically strangles me.6) And finally, did I mention that the stereo sound is loud, clear, and soaring...beautiful!!Cons:1) Controls on ear piece are a little hard to find with your fingers but you get used to it. Not easy to accidentally push a button when you grab the headphones.2) No bag provided to carry the headphones in.

Meaning, it's bright and somewhat annoying, but fairly normal, better than some in fact. The only way I could see it being a problem is in a small space at night. Say a car. But if you're driving with both ears covered, you've got more problems than blinking blue lights.2) The sound quality is better than 90% of the Bluetooth headsets I've tried. Way better than Jabra or Motorola. From a call perspective, it's about the same, but as a stereo headset, it's so much better. I can listen to opera and hear the high and low vocals without distortion, which was impossible on the last Jabra I had.3) It requires a pairing code!!! This is important to note. You can't pair it with a device that doesn't allow you to enter a code! So, it won't work with an off-the-shelf 3.5 or 2.5mm adapter. It pairs fine with my computer with built-in Bluetooth, and one of my cell phones because I can enter the code. It does not work with the Bluetooth dongle I bought for my MP3 player because no way to enter a pairing code. Also doesn't work with the USB Bluetooth radio I bought for my other PC. This I found annoying and was the chief reason I dropped a star from the rating. One way around this is to buy the 590A model, rather than the 590E model (the model I'm reviewing) because it comes with a paired adapter. However, the cost is much higher.4) Yes, as others have noted, this headset is made of hard plastic. The more flexible material many of us are used to in headphones is completely absent here. So, if you sit on them, as one user mentioned, you will break them. So don't sit on them. They're not tiny, so they're hardly unobtrusive.5) They are the rare over-the-head headphones. Most Bluetooth these days are behind the neck. I like behind the neck styles, but with very long hair, they're not the best option in the world. These stay on and are comfortable through several hours of wear, and haven't pulled out a single hair yet. My Jabra headphones ripped hair out constantly.6) The controls are mostly nice. I like that they're all on one ear. Some other sets have the controls spread out over the two ear phones, which I find annoying. The one thing I don't like in the controls is that I naturally think of volume as UP DOWN and tracks as BACK FORWARD. The controls are the complete opposite, which is odd to me. The UP button is track forward, the DOWN button is track back. The FORWARD button is volume up and the BACK button is volume down. I don't know who thought of that of that bit of engineering, but it shouldn't have made it out of the drawing room.Overall, I'm very happy with these headphones, there are some minor annoyances, but that can be said for every Bluetooth headphone on the market. The most important thing to me was that the sound quality be good for music play. I have many headsets for phone calls, but this was the first one that had nice music quality. I just wish it worked with a standard Bluetooth adapter. Perhaps next time.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2007", "summary": "Mixed bag, but overall a good buy"}

McCulloch", "helpful": [3, 3], "unixReviewTime": 1223769600, "reviewText": "I returned this headset because the audio quality was inadequate for music.I did not try to use this headset to make calls, so my review states no facts or opinions about the functionality of the microphone or any other call-related usage.I chose this headset intending to use it both for talking and for listening to music.The first thing I did was paired it with my Nokia N82 (which was very easy) and tried listening to music. Immediately I noticed that the sound quality was mediocre. Specifically, the upper frequencies are muddy. This destroys the possibility for really enjoying most, if not all, kinds of music.To be sure I wasn't imagining it, I did a comparison between this headset and the Nokia earbuds that came with my phone. Although the cheap Nokia earbuds have quite poor bass response, their high frequency response was so much better than the Plantronics, it was like night and day.That alone was reason enough for me to send them back, but there are a couple more things I didn't like about them. The first is the bright blue light that flashes on the right earphone when the unit is paired with a phone. This is probably not a big deal in a bright room, but in a dimly lit room it's very distracting for anyone who happens to be on your right. I wanted to use these for listening to music at work, but I share an office with two other people and we keep the lights off, so I know this may have been annoying for them. I also like want to be able to use the headset at night when I'm sitting in bed with the lights off, but when I tried this, even I could see the flashing blue light (while wearing the headset!) - and it lit up the whole room.Unfortunately the light can't be practically covered up, because it is a ring which surrounds the slim buttons used to control volume etc. It would be difficult to cover the light without interfering with the buttons.The last thing I didn't like was that this headset is quite tight. I was surprised about this because I actually have a small head for an adult male (22\" / 56cm). I don't think I could wear the headset for more than half an hour without becoming uncomfortable.On the plus side, the build quality seemed reasonable, they aren't uncomfortable apart from the tightness, and the extending microphone seems like a great idea (I just can't comment about how well it actually works).One interesting item to note is that there seems to be a 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom of one of the earpieces, but I saw no mention of it in the manual and no audio cable is provided. If this is an audio jack, it would make the headset useful for connecting to products without Bluetooth.Pros:- Extending boom mic should (presumably) work better than a mic embedded in the earpiece (but I didn't not test it).- Nice design.- Decent build.- I had no trouble pairing with my Nokia phone.- Compact.Cons:- Hopeless for music if you care about dynamic range.- Very bright flashing blue light can be distracting to others (and even the wearer) in a dark or dim room.- Tight.- No case provided.If music, bright lights, and possible discomfort during extended use do not matter to you, this product could would probably be quite good for phone calls.I should add that I have not yet tested my phone with any other stereo Bluetooth headsets; this means I cannot rule out my phone as the culprit in the case of the poor sound quality.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2008", "summary": "Disappointing for music listening"}

It replaced a Nokia 6682 Smartphone that I'd had for about 6 months.  Overall, I think this a nice phone with a great tiny camera.Keys/Physical Feel - It fits nicely in the hand and is quite small.  I'm not that happy with the keys. The joystick seems to be overly sensitive, and I have trouble hitting the right keys while text messaging.User Interface - It has a relatively snappy feel to it. Sometimes the main menu takes just a second to load up, but maybe this is the keys being unresponsive. It has the normal SE interface -- which is probably an industry-best for non-smartphone phones.Camera - It's pretty great! This is what I bought the phone for -- so it would allow me to have a decent camera with me at all times. The lens cover is a little flimsy but infinitely better than nothing at all. The camera is not that responsive, but the pictures turn out great.Phonebook - Good! Has tons of entries, is easy to use. I wish it would do full name searching, rather than starting with only the first name or the last name but I guess that is a smartphone-only feature for now.Connectivity - I'm bummed that OS X's iSync does not support this phone yet but I'm going to assume that it's just one update away since SE phones typically have very good iSync-compatibility.Sound - Good quality. I have not heard any complaints. One quirk that will take getting used to is that the charger and headphone use the same port, so if you want to talk and charge the phone you will need to daisy-chain them together. My third-party Cingular car charger lacks this daisy-chain functionality.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2007", "summary": "Fairly good phone"}

I also found the user interface to be superb and a better experience than that which I've had with similar Nokias (which are also excellent).  The use of a soft rubber coating on the back side was a nice touch by the designers.  Also, the camera is as good as it claims to be (but not better).  And finally, the phone syncs very easily with a Mac and iSync via a third-party plugin that you can acquire very inexpensively off the web (just search for \"Mac,\" \"iSync,\" and \"K790a\").My issues with the phone, and the main reason why I returned it, had to do with the low volume from the earpiece.  Even at its highest setting, it was still too low for me to hear the caller when I was in a relatively crowded or noisy environment (e.g., street intersection, restaurant/bar, indoor mall).  The phone also lacks dedicated \"Send\" and \"End\" keys, and instead are accessed by soft keys.  The this makes for an attractive layout, it can also be a bit inconvenient because the soft keys change function depending upon what you're doing, and it would've been nice if hard Send/End keys were available so that the soft keys could be assigned other useful function while in call.  Finally, I'm not a fan of joysticks and prefer directional pads.  I'm not convinced of the durability of joy sticks and don't find them as accurate or comfortable to use as D-pads.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007", "summary": "Excellent build quality, poor earpiece volume"}

Slightly heavier than w800i and Motorola V3.- Auto Focus.- Using Digital Image Processing to reduce photo noise does improve the picture quality compare to w800i and w810i.- 3.2 Mpix with various shooting effects and white balancing presets. I tried Twilight Portrait under low light condition for short range photos, I can say the quality can be compared to a real CyberShot Digi Cam.- Two shortcut bottons on the top of the phone near the speaker for browsing photos.- Xenon Flash can be Pros and Cons.  Effective range is 1 to 2 Meters.- Animated menu and customizable themes makes the phone more interesting- MP3 Ringtones- Multiple Recurrance Alarm schedule- FM radio can be set as Alarm.- Bluetooth 2.0 support A2DP (Advance Audio Distribution Profile) for Stereo Bluetooth Headphones- Able to backup phonebook into memory stick M2 and perfectly synchronizes calendar and contacts with OUTLOOK!!!!!!!!!!!- High Frame rate for 3D GAMES!!!  Although this phone does not have a 3D hardware accelerator, it does run 3D games such as Need for Speed Carbon, Virtual Tennis or other 3D games with high frame rates!  It is a lot faster than W800i and W810i!!!!- One button press for Speaker Phone- Able to turn ON/OFF Bluetooth and paring Bluetooth Devices such as adding Headsets during a call.- Multi-Tasking, supports up to 5 JAVA Applications, Music Player, Internet Browser, and other application simultaneously. (Once it reaches the 5 Java Applications, it does not allow user to open any more java programs and there might be stability issue)- Shortcut key to startup a \"Task Manager\" like menu for you to resume or end running applications.- File Manager works very well for copying, moving, and organizing data inside the phone.- If you have cell phone internet, make sure you go to Sony Ericsson Funs and Downloads to get all the useful applications, themes, ringtones and games.- NICE AC charger!  It comes with a Dual Connector which cascades the AC adaptor with the USB cable or headphone connector to charge your phone while you are using listening to music or connecting to PC.---------- CONS ---------------- Camera cover uses glossy material is easy to get finger prints and scratches. Also DO NOT PRESS ON THE COVER SO HARD when sliding!  It scratches the CAMERA LENS!!!!!!!!  BE CAREFUL!!!- Extremely low video recording resolution at 176x144!!!  Even a real cyber shot can do 640x480!  Nokia N73, N93, can do 640x480, samsung D900 and SHARP 902SH at 320x240.  Probably their microprocessor is not fast enough to handle hi-res video!- NO LED LIGHTS!!!  COME ON! LED is useful when I need to use it as a normal flash light or tourch in the dark!- Does not support stronger Xenon Flash accessories MXE-60 by Sony Ericsson.  I guarantee the MXE-60 is brighter than the K790A built in xenon flash!  The effective range is up to 4 Meters! Twice that of k790a!- Joystick seems to only support 4 directions (Up,down,left,right), the corners do not work, bad for games!- Xenon flash may be too strong to saturate the picture in white during close range.  It is also very weak for outdoor at night, since there is not enough light reflect back, the effective range is only 1 to 2 Meters (3-6 Feet).- You CANNOT manually turn ON the Flash, which is very useful when taking photo of a person with camera facing toward a bright background such as a sun or a bright sky.- Orange or infared LED for auto focusing does not work that well under extremely dark condition with ridge surface.- Primitive voice recognition system.  You must need to record the names and what kind of phone you are calling separately. Back in 2004, the samsung and motorola mpx220 also supports USER INDEPENDENT voice recognition system.  That means anyone can make a call regardless male or female, without training nor recording!- NetBrowser doesn't support xhtml web sites.  Cannot check Windows Live Mail. Recommend using OPERA MINI.  A lot faster and convenient!- No 900MHz- Crowded keypad, hard to press the number pad when they are at the very bottom of your hand and you are worrying about dropping the phone on the floor due to the center of mass leaning toward the camera cover. (Recommand using the given Sony Ericsson Handstrap)- Provided 64MB Memory Stick Micro is USELESS!- Impulsive noise between music tracks. Can be solved by using Bluetooth Headphone.- STEREO BLUETOOTH HEADPHONE does not support EQUALIZER SETTINGS- No Mega Bass, since Mega Bass is only in walkman branded phones, and usually muffles the music.  Customize the EQ for the best result.- Occasional crash when accessing the memory stick (May be mine is defected?)- Slow USB transfer speed.  Not even USB 2.0 as SE claimed---------- Suggestions & Recommendations ------------- get GOOGLE MAP, GMAIL and OPERA MINI.- Update the firmware via SONY ERICSSION UPDATE SERVICE.- Get a 1GB Memory Stick Micro, the given 64MB M2 is a piece of crap.- Delete some bundled applications or files can free up the phone memory from 64MB to 73MB.- Get a 99% transparent screen protector from EBAY or Online store. Not the soft ones, they easily get scratched.- Get a silicone case or clear casing for maximum protection.- Use glossy transparent tape to protect the \"CYBERSHOT\" lense cover from further scratches while maintaining it's original design.- Clean the dust clogged in the joystick, as the dust will eventually enter to the LCD screen in couple months even it is \"sealed\".", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2006", "summary": "Detail Pros and Cons for K790A"}

(Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2007", "summary": "Real digital camera in a cell phone"}

Since then no flip phone has ever been the same; I can't flip any of them with one hand with a flicking motion without thinking they'll fly against the wall.Since then, I have only gotten bar phones.  This one is the best I've used, of any type of phone.  Firstly, I love how Sony Ericcson's handle phonebooks; I don't know why but I like it.  When Motorolas read my sim card they screw it up and don't read each contact's numbers as a group, they give each number an individual entry.  I also think SEs have the sexiest fonts and graphics.The thing I like best about this phone is definately the fact that I can hook it up to my computer (it comes with a usb cable, separate from the charging cable, and a 50some MB memory card for starters; it can hold a lot though obviously it's not a portable hard drive but you can buy up to 2 GB so far, higher when you can buy the recently announced 4 GB card) and transfer images, videos, mp3s, and other files to/from the phone.  That means I can make custom backgrounds, ringtones, alerts (video, image, or audial) on my computer and then put them on my phone without being charged for sending over the cell networks.  Also, it has bluetooth and infrared, though I don't have any other devices that use these communication protocols.The real highlight of the phone, besides the fact that it doesn't drop calls ever, is the camera.  3 Megapixels is about the best you can get without buying from Asia and the quality is great.  It's true, at night in large spaces where the light can't reflect back, some residuals show up as artifacts (discolorations) but not enough to detract from all the rest of the features.  I feel like my phone's camera has more features than a real digital camera costing $600+.  I'm gonna turn it on and try to cover them all:There is a 'frame' feature which puts preset cartoony drawings on the screen and then you take a picture that will show up behind it (like an astronaut suit.... so any picture you take will have an astronaut suit overlayed on top of it; it's a good gimmick for kids).  There is a panoramic feature: you take 3 pictures from left to right and the camera will merge them for you.  There is a feature called 'best pic' which is for drunk or motion pictures: the camera takes 9 pictures very quickly and you can check through all of them to see which ones you want to save.  There are also tons of lighting, stability, and other options that I don't use because I trust the automatic settings (they have worked great so far).  My favorite options are the effects: color, black and white, negative, orangey (like old-fashioned photos), and overexposed (like a painting).  You can take videos in any one of these modes.  The video of my girlfriend dancing naked around a pole with black stalkings and heels is the best video i've ever seen; it was taken in negative mode and her stalkings are white, her skin is blue, her hair is white, and so is her private area... it looks like the gates of heaven.After you take photos/videos, you can also edit them.  You can zoom in/out and resave the picture, rotate it, add even more effects, overlay text, combine effects, you can trim videos.  The only downside is, when I converted movie files from my computer to 3gp format and put them on my phone, I couldn't edit them in the on-phone video editor because they were too long.  I can do that on my computer though; I was just too impatient.Also, the screen is large and quality; my friend asked me if this is high def. and I regularly jerk it to porn that I'm viewing on the phone.  There is plenty of free software available from sony that you can download to the phone (some of which allows you to change the colors of menus, fonts, etc).  Other features I like: mp3 player, fm radio player, tons of accessories you can buy.  I have owned the phone for a month and a half, have been playing with it constantly, and I am still finding new features.People also like my phone; when I tell them it is so new that Cingular didn't know it existed when I called to verify that it'd work on their network (it does even though they said it wouldn't) and that the only place that sells it is amazon.com, I wonder if they are impressed.  I think they are; I am.It sucks to have to pay $370 for a new phone but, screw it, when they release an even cooler phone that Cingular knows about, I will get that and sign up for the 2 year agreement.I'd bet that anyone who has the insight to buy this phone won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2007", "summary": "Best Phone I've ever used..... if only it were shaped like the StarTec"}

The clarity of the display is really excellent and above average. The MP3 player is definitely well above average in sound quality.  This phone does so many things so well that it almost gets a rating of 5.My main gripes are with some really important things.  The keyboard's feel is poor with the keys too close together.  The joystick works great when new but degrades if used for more than basic functions, like playing the provided games.  The camera lens cover and buldge is not great but never really bothered me that much.  Really the joystick is a feature I'll never have in another phone because it's just not durable and D-pads work just as well.I now use a T-Mobile Dash and it excels at many things the k790a stumbles on but does not offer the same level of sound quality nor close to as good a camera.  It is more useful for work, surfing the web and dealing with email and really makes the k790a look like more of a toy (but a great one) in comparison.

There is a new Samsung out that is about a half the size, but I don't know about the photoquality.  There are many factors that go into the quality of a photo, not just the megapixel count.  Other than the size and a few other things, I'm very satisfied with this phone/camera.  My overall goal was to be able to go out and about with only one electronics thing.  I dont want to carry my ipod, pda, camera, and phone everywhere.  This phone suffiently fulfills temporary and short-term outings.Here are the pros and cons.PROS:-Great screen, in terms of size and color-The phone/address book is very expandable, and can include unlimited phone numbers, addresses, and notes for each contact.  You can enter their address, birthday, whatever you want.  It syncs with Outlook, but I find that I only call regularly from my mobile phone a small portion of the people  from my outlook contacts.-Photos are very nice.  They are a bit smaller in file size than my old Sony 3.2 MP cybershot camera, but on the whole there is not much noticeable difference.  The daylight photos are great.  Low-light photos are very good for scenary, such as inside European churches, city streets, etc.  There is a very good image stabilizer, so the low-light photos are very good considering that my hands shake a lot.  Indoor people photos, however, are so-so.  This is true with any digital camera as a general rule.  But I've had problems with focusing (common) and sometimes i want to use the flash in the daytime (bright background, but person in shadow) and it doesnt always let me.  Still, it's convenient.-Great speaker sound, for music or speaker phone-Radio.  Nice add-on you don't get on a lot of the other 3.2 mp phones.-Good music playing.  Though you can't use your own headphones, you have to use the Sony ones that double as the hands-free microphone/headphones, the sound is very good.-You can copy and paste onto the memory card or phone any image photos and put them on your phone to show to people or for your own enjoyment.-Good battery life, if you don't have the screen lit up all the time.-I haven't used the 3G aspect of it, as this is expensive.  But the capability is nice.  Haven't tried out the internet either.-Despite the large size, it feels very comfortable to use.  It holds well in the hand, and the number pad keys are soft, though a bit close together.-Dedicated music play/pause button.-Good flash, with multiple flashes for red-eye reduction.-Nice leather hand strap.CONS:-Sending SMS to more than one person is a pain.  You have to go through several menus to select each person, one at a time.-Sony memory stick micro.  Yet another expensive sony memory card format.  MicroSD is the same size, and much cheaper.-Camera lens cover always sliding down.  The new Samsung and Nokia is much better in this respect.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2006", "summary": "A bit large and bulky, but good quality"}

It was everything I wanted in a phone. It's a liiiiittle bulky, but it does have a very good camera in it. It's very easy to navigate and easy to use, I like the UI. The brushed metal body is just as sturdy as my old T616.My only small complaint, which doesn't happen all the time, is the door that hides the camera lens gets slid down when it's in a bag or pocket, but it's just as easy to slide it shut. Oh, and another thing - the key command for locking the keys on the T616 was * and the left action button, and its reversed on the K790a.Good phone, if you like candy bar style phones or loved your old T616, you'll like this phone.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2008", "summary": "Great Phone, Silly Sliding Camera Cover"}

I used this feature at the golf course one day to analyze my golf swing frame by frame and when I got the timing of the shutter right i ended up with some outstanding frames.  i thought that the golf club would be just a blury line in the pictures but to my surprise the pictures were flawless you could see the club as if i stoped my swing just before during and after i hit the ball.  ANYONE WHO ALREADY OWNS THIS PHONE I SUGGEST YOU TRY DOING WHAT I JUST EXPLAINED.(really cool stuff)Another cool feature with the camera phone is panaramic mode where you take 3 pictures side by side to make one long or panaramic picture.  When i first used PANORAMA mode i was blown away.  Just that one feature alone made me very excited about this phone.  Picture Blog is a nice feature also. I enjoy creating my own ring tones with the music MUSIC DJ.  The radio freature is good it has quality radio sound.  The MP3 player is nice whether you play it on the speaker or through the headset that is included with the phone (headset doubles as a hands free talk set also) phone includes a 64MB memory stick which is sufficient enough to get started.  VIEDO DJ feature is a really fun tool.  You can get really creative with your videos, music, and pictures.MINI GOLF is fun to play when killing time.  But why play golf when you can create your own video with VIDEO DJ.  The only bad thing i discovered in my short time with this phone is that the speaker phone could be louder just a miner downfall that definetly should not deter you from buying this phone.

While this causes the phone to go into \"picture taking mode\" temporarily, it quickly goes back into sleep mode while in its case and does not exhaust the battery.

Knapek", "helpful": [9, 10], "unixReviewTime": 1161388800, "reviewText": "I fell in love with this phone the first time I saw it on the SonyEriccson website and decided I had to have it. I researched it for at least month and waited longer before I received it. I read so many reviews about certain parts of the phone that were amazing and other parts that were just okay. I never saw the phone in person so I was only able to dream about it, and let me tell you, I've had the best of the best phones. Well now I have the K790A and all I can say is that it is simply fabulous (and I don't use that \"F\" word very often!) Here's my take on a few features:- First off, the screen is brilliant! It is the most clear screen I have ever seen (on a cell or elsewhere). The graphics are so clear that they actually look like someone designed it on a computer, printed it out with the best printer available on the best paper, and inserted it behind the glass. You can't even see the pixels! I could go on, but enough about the screen (it's amazing).- One thing I was really concerned about after reading all of the reviews was how most people called it bulky. My favorite phone until now was a Motorola RAZR, so the bulky comments concerned me. Let me assure you that this phone is in not bulky whatsoever. There may be phones that are slimmer, but it does not deserve that nickname. I can barely feel it in my pocket, and while the sliding cover for the lens does stick out a bit further, it's not a problem for me in the least.- The built-in Cyber-Shot camera is one of the coolest features. When it's in camera mode it's hard to remember after a few seconds that you're on a phone. Sony Ericsson sure didn't skimp on the camera software. Everyone who sees it while I'm taking a photo says \"How funny...I thought that was a phone!\" and it's so great to be able to respond with \"it is\". From the back it looks like a camera, so I understand the confusion. I admit Indoor photos are something you have to tweak with and they're still not wonderful, but they work for a camera phone (I have yet to get any developed). On the other hand, the outdoor photos are a totally different story! They are MUCH better than I had anticipated. I don't think I'll sell my stand-alone digital camera just yet, but it's wonderful to have a good camera with me everywhere I go so that I don't miss out on those unexpected moments.- Now to the next cool feature. Let me explain that I'm a 100% techie, and this is something I must comment on. If you haven't seen Sony's new Memory Stick Micro, it's definitely something that will amaze you. It'about square, but it's the width of my pinky finger. If you're into stuff like that, you're going to drool over it.- One thing I will confirm after reading it multiple times in other reviews is the earpiece volume. It's not loud. If you're hard of hearing you may want to consider something else. It does include a stereo headset that you can use for calls also, but let me warn you that since it's stereo it's got two ear pieces, not one like most normal headsets.I really wish I could go on about more features and write a full review, but I realize no one probably wants to read quite so much. My bottom line opinion is that it's worth every single penny if technology and the \"newest\" stuff is your thing.[...]Thanks for reading!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2006", "summary": "Simply amazing!"}

I loved everything about it, but the K790 / K800i phone is EVEN better:1. bigger and brighter screen size and higher resolution. As a result, the phone is slightly larger than the w800i but the benefits outweighs the size increase. The icons are bigger and clearer. Font size is increased so it's much easier to read text messages. You can now surf the web (not just mobile web pages.) Being able to display the photos on a larger screen is great.2. I LOVE the RSS reader. With a click of a button, the phone updates the latest news from BBC and Google news and SONY news and updates. I just skim through the head lines which are linked to fuller articles on the websites. This is great for me who commutes on the train every morning. Great time killer standing up or sitting on the train.3. Walkman is still great. It's not as buggy as W800i. But there is no more MegaBass. It still sounds great. Unfortunately, the phone does not come with memory card. I had to buy one M2 (Memory Stick MICRO) which I had to wait about a month to get since it's really new and not many stores have them in stock. So if you want to fill up the phone with songs, built-in 64MB will not be enough.4. The camera quality is excellent (for phone camera, that is). I am very particular about digital cameras and picture quality. I find that this camera is overall not as good as a basic, stand-alone, cheap 3 Mpix cameras that are cheaper. HOWEVER, it good lighting condition, it takes great picutres. There is definitely more noticible purple fringe and digital noise than a dedicated digital camera. In low-light condition, even with the super bright flash light, the picture quality is sub-par. There is too much noise. The metering on the camera is so-so. If there is a strong lighting constrast between your subject and the background (such as bright windows), I find the camera has a hard time balancing the light--making the subject too dark. The ability to have a portable camera with me at all time, out weighs all the imperfections I get from it. As a graphic designer, it's important to have access to a camera at all time to grab images for design inspirations.5. I am curious to start the photo Blog--a built-in feature in the phone.6. Games look great on this camera. 3D games like MiniGolf and Tennis which came with the phone are amazing.7. Built-in ring tones and background screen/wall paper sound and look SO much better.8. Email function works great. I have a dot.mac account and can view and send emails without problems. Right now, the phone does not support flash player so I can't view any .fla files. I don't really care but sometimes websites do require that flash player is installed.This phone has amazed me and impressed me beyond my expectations.

I owned before this one, a Nokia 6020 and 6131 phones with VGA and 1.3 MP cameras respectively, but when compared, the SE 790a is the winner. It is really a little point and shoot camera with a phone atached. Specially for indoor/night pictures, the flash is top; even if you are in total darkness the AF work and you can use the flash in auto mode (not red eye reduction) and help it with a separetely slave flash unit for better lighting. Is good idea to order with the phone the car charger, so you will be always loaded, and the 512 MB memory card, because the phone only has a 64 aditional card plus the inside memory wich is not enough; both items has free shipping from Amazon. On the other side the standard headset could not be used at the same time with the charger, so if you plane to do this you will need the special headset for this purpose, and it is quite expensive. Another cons are the very low volume on the rear speaker: you could not hear a conversation and write a note. If you use the calendar option frecuently and you want the phone reminder you any event weekly, for example, it is a paine, because it did not have this function. You should copy the name of the event and change the date for every day you want it work, again and again....Something Sony Ericsson should do for improve, is to put some type of locking device, a button perharps, for the lens cover, so it will not slide in the wrong moment.

Works so well, sounds passable to the called party on the highway with the windows sunroof open- Easy simple controlsCONS:- Not comfortable for long periods of time.

Let me point out that all the negative reviews seems to be for use with a computer; I have no interest in using my headset with my computer (over-rated when you have a nearly unlimited cell phone plan and have no need for international long distance).  This review is strictly meant for using this device with your cell phone.I have owned at least 5 different BT headsets, a lower-level Jabra, a high-end Plantronics, and a mid-level Samsung, to name a few.  And I hear it from my friends and family when the device does not work well.  When using any of these devices, family members frequently say, \"What?\" or \"your headset is awful.\"I owned my first one of these Logitech headsets about 1.5 years ago (purchased on eBay for about $20).  It lasted a year and only met its demise when a cat decided it was better suited as a toy than a headset, and the ear loop broke off.Apparently, these headsets (the same model, only not packaged with the bluetooth adapter) became incredibly rare, as the price went up to almost $100.  However, you can get the exact same headset with the bluetooth adapter for half that price!  On with the review:Pros:My friends/family can't even tell I am on a headset when I use this.  It is crystal clear, no distortion.This headset has the best wind-stop technology I have ever used; as in it actually works.Battery life lasts at least 2 days (I charge it whenever I charge my phone, and don't usually have a problem).It fits more comfortable to me than an in the ear device.  It is larger than most headsets, but I like the size as it helps keep me from losing it.  It probably wouldn't be comfortable to wear for several consecutive hours, but why would you want to?  Just put it on when you are on the phone.Negatives:There are some flaws, despite being the greatest headset ever.  It is an older model, so it does not have BT 1.2 (which carries a greater range).  If you are leaving the room while on your headset, expect to have to bring your phone with you.The ear ring will break... eventually.  It is inevitable.  But, if you treat it right, don't try to rotate it a full 360 degrees, and keep it away from cats, it will last.Finally, it is no longer in production, which means once they are gone, they are gone.  That is why the headset (not packaged with the adapter) has gotten so expensive.  Those who use them keep wanting them.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2009", "summary": "Best Bluetooth Headset ever Created!... for a cell phone."}

But, all in all, I am pleased with the Cardo Scala 700.  Occasionally, I do get quite a bit of static but that tends to be during the initial stages of the call while dialing.  Once connected, I rarely get static unless I am talking with my girlfriend &lt;g>.  If I am in a noisy environment, people sometimes have a hard time hearing me but that is infrequent.  I have had some difficulty keeping this working with my Treo 700wx but I have never figured out if it is the cellphone or the Bluetooth headset.  Usually, if I \"refresh\" the headset on the phone, it will work fine once again.  The ability to easily switch it from one ear to the other without any hassle is also nice.  I am very impressed with the battery life.  I've had this for a month and despite sometimes not charging it for a couple days, I have never run out of juice.  Most importantly for me is the comfort.  Once I figured out how to adjust the ear band so there are no pressure points, I don't even realize I have it on; that's how light it is.  In fact, a couple times it has been on when I laid down in bed at night and I didn't realize it until I rolled over and put that ear on my pillow.  This is probably an odd comment but it is so lightweight that it almost feels cheap; in the same way as if you were to hold a cheap $5 Kmart Blue Light Special watch in one hand and in the other hand, you hold a Rolex, which feels more substantial.  Still, I'll take the lightweight headset anytime.  If I were to buy a Bluetooth headset as a gift, this would be the one.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2007", "summary": "Cardo Scala 700 much better than expected"}

Using Sprint RAZR2. Wearing glasses3. My first BT headsetI really don't have much expectation about BT headsets after doing some extensive research. Common complaints: 1. Not comfortable; 2. Audio not good or not loud enough; 3. The other side hear static; 4. Poor BT pairing.As I wear glasses, I really wonder if I can find a BT headset that fits. There're some positive reviews about Cardo Scala 700 used by people wearing glasses, plus the review on audio quaality is above average, so I decided to give it a try, despite there're plenty of promotions (even free) during the time of the purchase - Thanks Giving.I've been using the headset for 6 months now, so I think it's a good time to give it a fair (personal) review.Pros:1. Audio is good. It's loud and clear... sometimes even too loud for me.2. The package comes with a carrier, a wall charger and most important of all, a USB charger. As a result, I rarely use the wall charger as I always charge it next to my laptop.3. There're only 2 buttons on the headsets, one dial and one button. It gets a little time to \"memorize\" the basic functions by using the combination of 2 buttons, but I think I'm comfortable with it after using it for a month. Yes, you HAVE to read the manual, and it's even better if you read it several times.4. Pairing with the RAZR is very easy. I've never had any issues once paired.5. The unit is very light and doesn't look bulky at all.6. Battery life is pretty good. It never runs out (almost).. and I usually recharge it once a week.7. Customer service from Cardo Scala is good. The earloop was broken after using it for 5 months. I received response from the company 1 day after I had emailed them. Then 4 days later I got the earloop replacement via USPS.There're a couple features that may matter to others but not me:A. Allow me to search for the headset from the phone. Haven't tried this feature yet as I leave it at the same place at work or home... it's more likely that I forget where I left the phone!B. Multi-paring... I only have 1 phone, so I don't need to pair with another oneCons:1. Cheaply made... especially the area around the dial and the charger area. Being light is one thing, but there're some area where a little details matter.2. The earloop broke after a free fall from waist level after 5 months of use. Seems like the plastic used on the earloop isn't strong enough.3. The audio is reset back to default after turning off the headset, and the default volumne of the headset is pretty high.4. Once you put the headset to mute (by holding the dial during conversation), you can't adjust the volume. I found this one of the biggest cons and very annoying.5. Again, while on mute, the headset reminds you that you're on mute by beeping every 10 or 20 seconds. The beeps are just too long (2 beeps that lasts almost 2 seconds) that I miss the conversation from other parties. In case you wonder why it matters, I use the headset to join conference call.6. The end of USB cable that attaches to the headset is NOT standard mini-USB. It would be so much better to carry just 1 USB cable so that I can charge the RAZR and the headset7. Like all other BT headsets, static is still a problem. When no static is present, people can still tell I'm on cellphone or using BT headset, even I'm in a quiet room. And I must say the RAZR's audio and mic quality is pretty darn good.8. Not easy to adjust the earloop to a comfortable and snuggle position. At a reasonable snuggle and comfortable position, the mic points to my nose instead of my mouth.9. It fits ok with my glasses, although far from perfect. However I may have to try out others in order to see whether this one is better than the rest.10. The indicator light blinks even though I'm not on a call. Well, I can see why it's blinking, just to remind me that the headset is on... however I hope there's a better way to \"remind\" me that, or allow me to disable the blinking.11. Noise cancellation... is there any? The box says it does, but apparently not good enough.I will keep using it as I paid more than $30 bucks for it. It's acceptable, but again I have to work around some of the annoying stuff. But then I doubt there's anything that cost less than $50 and offers excellent voice quality and fit comfortably.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2007", "summary": "Decent, but not good enough"}

I've got to admit, I should have paid more attention to those reviews.  The tin can effect is quite pronounced and voice sounds muffled.  Comparing this to my previous BT, the sound quality is poor.2) Outgoing Sound Quality:  This is not bad if you are sitting in a quite room.  However even minor background noise is audible at the other end.  Good luck if want to use this in your car or at an airport!3) Comfort:  Contrary to several reviews, the headset is quite comfortable to wear.  You just need to get a hang of how to wear it - the key is to let it hang loosely in your ear canal.4) Style and Size:  This is definitely stylish without being too obtrusive and definitely much smaller than my previous headset (Logitech Mobile Traveler)In balance I would say this one does not cut it primarily due to the poor incoming sound quality - try the Jabra 500, Plantronics 655 or the Aliph Jawbone.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2007", "summary": "Poor audio quality"}

I've previously used and returned a Jabra JX10 (callers complained of background noise) and a Plantronics 510 (it couldn't maintain a connection with the Treo).This is the winner of the three.  It paired immediately, and it doesn't lose the connection with the (notoriously finicky) Treo 700p.  If I walk away with the phone and later return them together again, the Scala usually reconnects automatically.  If it doesn't, a tap on the side of the Scala reconnects them in about 1-2 seconds.  Ditto if I turn off the Scala then turn it back on.It's also comfortable and plenty loud.  I found the volume rocker very easy to use.  Amazingly, I can use this headset in a convertible at freeway speeds; I can hear the caller and the caller can hear me.  That's simply astonishing.  It's worked well in light wind so far.The range seems to mirror other Bluetooth headsets with the usual amount of static if the phone isn't in line of sight.  As is common, the headset works best when it is positioned on the same side of your body as the phone.The Scala 700 can supposedly pair with up to 10 phones and can rapidly switch between two of them.  I have not tried this.Battery life is impressive, and it charges quickly.  The phone comes with a wall charger and a USB cable charger.  Note that the plug on the Scala uses a custom connection, so you cannot use a standard USB to mini USB cable to charge it.It also comes with a small belt loop to hold the unit when not in use.  I've found that it's small enough to simply put in my pocket.  There's also a feature that helps you find it when it's lost.  Place a call and then rapidly move your phone's volume up and down.  This causes the Scala to vibrate and make a noise.  It's useful if you misplace your headset.All in all, I'm very pleased.Pros:- Pairs quickly, stays paired, re-pairs automatically- Plenty loud- Decent range- Pairs with multiple phones- Good battery life- Helps you find it when misplaced- Excellent priceCons:- Not as small as JX10 and othersI hope you found this review helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2006", "summary": "An excellent pick"}

Out of the packaging and all charged up, it took a lot of talking over 2 days to put a proverbial dent in the rechargeable battery - the simple battery strength reading is a great feature. Another fine feature is the ability to easily turn off the standby light. It plays a brief midi melody from \"Flight of the Valkyries\" when a call is received, but also when a text message is received - I'd prefer it didn't tell me I just got a call when I didn't.Controls are well laid out with most of the outer face being the control button, and the top of the unit being the volume wheel - the wheel and control button share much of the duties, the only one I found odd was the volume wheel controlling call-waiting, I accidentally hung up on 2 calls over this. The control button activates voice dialing and answers calls very quickly, minimal lag.The unit is not the smallest, but a decent small, compact size and light weight. The body feels overall solid as it's a 1-piece-design, but up-close there are elements that feel cheap and plasticky, the large seam in the middle flexes slightly when grasped, the light window flexes in easily, and the control button is a little loose in its travel so it rattles, it's slight but when it's up on your ear it's a noticeable sound. I had no problems at all with the small ear loop, no discomfort and it shaped easily.I don't like having things in my ear canal, so this alternative design was what I was looking for with the larger metal-grille-covered speaker that hovers just outside the ear canal. However, the plastic housing around it isn't rounded enough so a button press jams hard plastic into the side of the ear, a little painful.Static is common here, whether sitting near the computer, laying on my side, or just standing right next to the phone, there'd be a little to a moderate amount of static which got frustrating after a while since I thought Bluetooth 2.0 in the headset and my phone is supposed to minimize that. The unit has good distance in my apartment, works through walls, but turns into a static farm when the microwave is running. I also found when I placed it in standby mode near my cordless house phone, that phone picked up a slight distortion.Finally, the thing that damned it in my eyes is sound quality. The speaker is generally loud enough, the mic slightly less so but fairly adequate pick-up. People can hear me, and I can hear them, but both the mic and the speaker sound are muffled and have tin-can effect. The underwhelming sound quality hampers natural conversation, there wasn't one call I made over 2 minutes that didn't have a \"what, what?\" moment on both ends because we could hear the other person saying something but it wasn't clear what that was. The sound quality is just not there with this one, and that's the whole point of it.EDIT - the next person who reviewed this reminded me of another drawback, there is a constant background hiss whenever the unit is active. Other BT headsets I've tried with this phone haven't had that issue.I was disappointed enough to send this back and ask for an exchange after just 3 days, I need better sound quality. Never the less, I've seen far worse performers out there that cost more, and people generally could hear me, and I them. When I next need a BT headset, I'll keep Cardo on my list to check in on, but the Scala 700 isn't there yet.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2007", "summary": "Underwhelming sound, other design issues, but good battery"}

I loved it, unfortunately I lost the darn thing.  I was so happy with the first one that I went back to Cardo and decided to try the 700.  The 700 works well but the 2 things I noticed that are different from the 500 is that they changed the adjustable wire piece that goes around your ear.  This new version is not as comfortable as the old one was.  They also changed the connection for the A/C charger.  It works but I liked the older style better.  If I had to choose between the two, I prefer the Cardo Scala 500 over the 700.  One other thing I don't like about either one, and drives me crazy is that while you're having a conversation with someone, if they start talking, whether you're talking or not, the mouth piece shuts down so the person on the other end always has full control of the conversation.

I appreciate the USB cord charging (one less cord to lug around), and it connects to the phone pretty quickly when it rings.The downsides I have are mostly around sound quality. I could drive the 500 to the point where it would hurt my ear and I'd need to turn it down. This one doesn't get that loud, and it's tough to hear if you aren't in a quiet area. The mike quality isn't that great, either - people can tell you're on a headset, not on a normal cell phone. But it's tolerable.On the really picky front, the batter life doesn't seem to be up there with the 500. I have to recharge this one at least twice a week, where I could easily keep the 500 running for a week. The \"mute\" on the headset plays an annoying tone every 30 seconds which blocks out what the caller is saying.

The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.  I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2007", "summary": "Actually works with the Treo 650"}

I also get a lot of \"can you repeat that\" or \"I can't hear you\" which again is disappointing because the Scala 500 did not have these issues.

But listeners frequently complained about the quality, so I stopped using it.  Then, doing some web research, I discovered the Cardo Scala 700, which I then purchased in November.  (It had just replaced the Scala 500.)  It's been my constant companion ever since (6 months how).Once I got the ear hook shaped right, it is quite comfortable - often I'm not even aware it's on.  I've experimented with switching back and fort from the Cardo to my Treo mic, and listeners say there's no discernable difference.  At first there were some minor difficulties getting it linked, but after the first few weeks it and my Treo have become fast friends.  Also, the look is quite 'cute' - and not as bulky or boxy as many which are sprouting from people's heads these days.I was a little bothered by the slight \"rattle\" of the black face cover (also a button), but a miniscule drop (from a sharp toothpick end) of some glue (I used Gorilla Glue) at the 'point' fixed that problem.I'll notice some static when my Treo and my Cardo aren't well alighed (like when my body is between them) - but the problem is minimal, and my listeners claim they can't hear any interference.  It seems to carry a lot of charge - I've never had it run out on me, and the recharge time each evening seems quite minimal.It has many more functions than I commonly use.  I primariliy use off and on, and turn off the blue flashing light.  I've never been comfortable with that cyborg head flashing blue light look.  Once in awhile I'll press the button that does last number re-dial, with sometimes embarassing results.My favorite use of it is when driving.  I can do a quick look down at my Treo and see who's calling, and then just talk away when the call arrives - hands free.  It's gotten to the point where I get irritated with myself when I have to hold my Treo to my ear!  Though after I've received a call, I can put the Cardo on, and press the button that turns it on - seamlessly in the middle of a conversation.  Obvioiusly my Cardo has spoiled me!

The Bluetooth pairing is fast and easy, and I have not ever lost that pairing. The headset picks up audio of incoming/outgoing calls quickly. I have not experienced any missed calls.The Scala 700 works as equally well as the Scala 500 with the Treo 650. However, I prefer the Scala 700 for the following reasons. (1) The Scala 700 is noticeably smaller than the Scala 500. (2) You can disable the blinking light on the Scala 700 if you don't like it. (3) You can press a button on the 700 to indicate the amount of battery power remaining: high, medium, or low. (4) The Scala 700 comes with 2 cables for charging (the usual wall plug cable, as well as a USB cable for charging off a computer/laptop). (5) Using your phone's volume control, you can get the Scala 700 to buzz, in the event you've misplaced it.  (6) While I have no use for it, this headset can be paired with up to 8 different phones.  Handy if you intend to share it with others.Some other reviewers have complained about the ear loop not feeling comfortable. I have not found that to be true. In fact, I prefer the ear loop that comes with the Scala 700, because I can shape it to contour my ear more closely.Additionally, I can't complain about the sound quality of this headset. I've asked a few of my callers how I sound, and all have said that I sound clear. While driving my car at highway speeds (with windows closed, radio turned off), callers could hear some background noise but indicated it was minimal. All callers said that I sounded clear and audible.  I should point out that I have not tested the headset in windy conditions. But that's not of concern to me, as it will be used primarily for use while driving.Occasionally, I'll notice some audible interference (static or click sounds) on the headset. I haven't determined any specific cause for it, but it always disappeared as quickly as it came.  And it doesn't come often.Lastly, this headset has a voice dial feature, but the Treo 650 does not support voice dial with Bluetooth headsets. Even though you may see references to \"Voice Tags\" in the Treo's preferences screen and user manual, voice dialing is only supported when using a specific brand of hands-free car kit.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2007", "summary": "Works great with the Palm Treo 650"}

It is a loud obnoxious generic ringtone.After speaking to Cingular customer service, and speaking to Motorola customer service, APPARENTLY there is no way to change the ringtone to anything other than 'continental' when the bluetooth is on.Folks, DO NOT waste your money downloading ringtones from the internet, because they won't work anyway if y ou use bluetooth.And don't waste your money on any motoroloa bluetooth headpieces if you want to have a different ringtone than 'continental'!The funny thing is, I have several friends that have motorola phones and motorola bluetooth earpieces that don't have this issue, but when I told the Motorola customer support about that, they don't seem to care and tell me it shouldn't work that way and it's not supported with anything other than Continental ringtone.

And it can be easily turned on when it is in the pocket and redial the last phone number.

I've had no issues with any of the features.The headphones feel tight around the head, but that's good. They're nice and snug. I have a pretty big head and I don't even have these headphones extended all the way out (whereas on my old headphones I had to use the longest extension).The \"sound canceling\" is misleading because the headphones don't actually have any noise canceling like Bose headphones do, but I guess the snugness of the ear piece is what is referred to as \"sound canceling\" here. I think it's the wrong term to use because obviously a lot of sound leaks through, but the headphones do a decent job of blocking some of it out.What disappointing is that there's no standard input jack, only one of those skinny phone inputs. So, you can't just plug them directly with a regular cable.I haven't had any battery life issues, but I've never had them on for more than 8 hours. They seem to recharge very quickly too.Call quality is great. I wish I could turn up the volume up ever more at times though. Some of my callers who like to whisper are hard to hear.The \"one click\" redial button is very convenient. Just press the \"Call\" button for 2 seconds and it will automatically dial your last-used contact. Very cool.Build quality seems very sturdy. The little flap that covers the inputs is awful though. I estimate that it will break within a matter of months, but the headphones themselves feel very good.Overall, the fact that it's Bluetooth compatible is worth the $30 alone. Most other full DJ-style headphones start at least $80. Even if these headphones aren't for you, the next-to-nothing price is well worth the value.

I have had them for about a year and a half now and they are reaching the end of their life cycle. Phones are really only designed to last about a year and these use a battery based on a mobile phone's battery so it is getting to the point where it doesn't hold much of a charge anymore.They are quite functional if not occasionally finicky with the signal. I have never had a problem getting them to pair with a phone but getting them to work with Windows XP, Vista or 7 is flaky at best. Windows 7 is much better but it is still pretty hit and miss. I don't think it is the headphones, though.The controls are good if basic - answer phone/on/off, pause, volume up/down, skip forward/back. They are quite intuitive once you get accustomed to where they are. I would say the dial style control for the volume and track skip is easier to use than buttons.The volume is fine but not deafening. I found myself looking for more volume than was available in situations like a noisy bus ride or mowing the lawn. That said, the noise isolation is quite good but they could have given the speakers more punch.The leather ear pads are quite comfortable. I often use my headphones while exercising and for all types of activities. The problem with using them while exercising is it makes my ears sweaty but the headphones aren't at fault there.A really nice feature which is unusual for Bluetooth headsets is you can use these as regular headphones. You need a 2.5mm headphone jack to plug into the headphones, and a cord connected to a 3.5mm jack to plug into your source. I don't think this comes stock but I find it baffling why they wouldn't include it as they bothered to design it that way but then they don't include a little cord to facilitate that. It is handy when the battery runs out, you can still connect to many devices. The quality when they are plugged in is much better.The integrated microphone is another nice feature although people did mention it wasn't super clear on the phone calls where I was using it. You can also use it with programs like Skype if you can configure your computer to handle it properly. It would be nice if you could use the microphone as a plug in microphone like you can with the headphones.With so many great features it is a shame they didn't pay more attention to quality in other areas such the design and strength of plastic. The swivel area is built to fail as the design is too tight and the plastic is brittle. The lay flat design should have been a feature but it compromises the structure of the headphones. One of the reasons why I got these is because they lay flat, so I could transport them in my backpack. I don't recommend this at all as they are not built tough enough for being jostled around. At this stage they are held together completely by crazy glue and they keep breaking in different places so the original plastic is being gradually replaced like crazy glue fossilization.If you like wearing things that light up (I don't) you will be pleased that these come with flashing lights. These can be turned off by holding down the buttons on both sides simultaneously for two seconds. You have to do it every time you turn the headphones on.On the next version of this product I would like to see: better quality construction, a search function as well as a skip function, make the volume controls work when they are plugged in as conventional headphones, allow for the microphone to work if plugged in and a replaceable battery, like is standard in a mobile phone.I would recommend this if you don't intend on being too rough on them, like if you just want to use them at home and if you don't expect more than a year's use out of them. They are brilliant for what they do and they have some features that make them stand out from the competition but the poor construction makes it difficult for me to truly recommend them.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2010", "summary": "Functional Headphones - Cheap Plastic"}

Sound quality is very good at reasonable volumes and I love the controls.  Battery longevity is phenomenal!  Main problem is the plastic half-rings that hold the earpieces tend to break, especially if you fall asleep while wearing these.  If they break then _don't_use_super-glue_.  There is so much leverage on the weak spots that super-glue has no chance to hold it together.Here's what I've found that finally works after three tries fixing these things:Each half-ring is shaped like a trough with internal dividers.  Rough up the insides of the trough with sandpaper, especially the box-shaped space right under the \"pivot\"  -- I used a dremel carefully with a fine ball-shaped cutter (just rough the surface; don't remove too much plastic.)  While doing this don't touch any of the mating surfaces where the broken pieces join.If there are any cracks that did not break through completely then drill out the end of each crack to keep it from growing longer using the finest drill bit you have (I used the dremel here again) .  Use ABS cement from the hardware store to glue the broken pieces together: cover the mating surfaces completely with a _thin_ coat of ABS cement; hold the pieces together for a couple minutes; then let the glue set for at least an hour.  (Super-glue will _not_ hold!)Now fill the \"trough\" with a mixed two-part epoxy (resin+hardener; follow the directions that come with the epoxy) -- this is what you roughed-up the surfaces for.  If you leave the surfaces \"shiny\" it may seem to stick, but it will break again in a few days.  Let the epoxy cure for 48 hours.Reassemble and enjoy!If I had it to do all over again I'd fill it with epoxy _before_ it broke.Hope this helps!-- J.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2009", "summary": "Nice, but fragile.

I am so pleased that I decided to write my own review.  Yes, it took more than 4 hours to charge.  I haven't had it long but the battery seems fine.  I thought I had it charging at work. At lunch I disconnected it and threw it in my gym bag.  I left work early and when I try to turn it on it wouldn't.  When I got home I charged it and today it worked fine.  Not sure if that was my error or not.  The sound is very good and it does a fair job in blocking out surrounding noise.  I read in another review that someone had bad quality sound when using his computer but great sound with his mobile device.  Well on my computer the bluetooth gave me an option of using my headphones as \"headphones\" or \"headset\".  With the headset option the sound was poor but in headphone option it was perfect.  I think headset is for voice conversations via internet and headphones is for listening to music.  I was at the gym on one of the cardio machines when I received a call.  Quality was very good on my end, the other end made no complaints.  Took them to the gym twice now and had no issues with them staying on.  I do wear them outside my hoodie.  I like the controls but with the iPhone you can't use the track control.  You can use the volume, play/pause, and of coarse talk buttons.  The signal did cut out a few times but I think it could be the surroundings.  On the bus and at the gym, no problem.  Walking outside, it cuts out.  Seemed worse in downtown. I read this issue with other bluetooth headphones so it may not be the product but the technology. Paring was no problem, but I ran into some issues when it was paired to two devices.  My computer refused to disconnect to allow the phone to connect the headphones.  I had to turnoff the bluetooth on my computer completely and pair my mobile again.The price is good and it seems durable and well made.

These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me, and then some!These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight, but they also won't have you feeling overly weighed down, either. They're simply solid-feeling in weight and construction. I read many other reviews of these online, one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half, and who paid over $120.00 for his pair. Considering the price that I got these for (comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon), I feel like I got mine at a steal, at less than $40.00!These Motorola headphones FEEL like they're worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I didn't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these ISN'T going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.As far as taking calls on these go, there is no obvious microphone on these, but they work great, just the same. My callers had no problems whatsoever hearing me on these, and I could hear them beautifully on them as well. I was told that the audio being received from these was loud, crisp, and clear, and the same seemed to be the case for me as well on the other end of the calls. I've also had no trouble using the operational buttons, and my phone found and paired with these headphones easily. The only thing that I didn't remember when I ordered these, though (completely my own fault), is that I won't be able to wear these to take calls while I'm driving, as traffic laws dictate that both ears cannot be covered and obstruct vital traffic sounds. Oh well. My bad.Overall, I am SO thrilled with these headphones. I always found the single-ear Bluetooth headsets to look a little ridiculous, so I was all too eager to get a stereo set of Bluetooth headphones that didn't look odd or awkward. These headphones ARE large, but they're solidly made, and look like an expensive, high quality piece of audio equipment.

I owned a bluetooth Plantronics headset before this one, and in comparison between the two, this one had the better quality in sound. Much cleaner and not so much muffled.2. ) Very comfortable. Wearing these for hours on end and while also laying in bed to listen to music or to carry out a conversation over Skype or XFire.3. ) Easy access controls for music and adjustment. The left and right ear only have one button, and a nob that goes around the outer circumference of the ear. The left nob (Located on the left ear) controls the volume while the right nob (right ear) controls skipping songs. Left button (left ear) (looks like a Phone icon) controls the Power, and pairing for the unit The right button (right ear) controls the Pause/Stop/Play of whatever media player you use. (I don't use this button at all, so I'm unable to give further detail into it.)4. ) The microphone is well hidden, if not invisible if you're not looking at it right. The microphone is actually located in the right ear cup that look like 5 holes going down the side of it closest to the leather-like ear foam, covered from the underneath to protect it from the wind. Decent clarity from the mic in comparison to using my laptop's built in microphone.5. ) If you're wearing the headset while turning it on, it does give you a confirmation that the headset is turned on through 5(?) rapid beeps, from lower note to higher note. As well if you are turning it off, hold down the power button (phone icon button), listen for 1 beep, keep holding it down until you hear 5 beeps for it to be turned off (higher tone to lower).6. ) Battery Life is pretty consistant, 17 hours is a bit of a stretch, but about 10 hours of constantly listening to music and gaming is acceptable to my standards. I have not tested standby mode or \"talk-life\" due to I plug in the headset when I'm done with it to its charger.Cons :1. ) As with all bluetooth stereo headsets with microphones, the moment you want to use it to talk, it switches straight to \"Mono\" sound. Meaning everything, as for gaming, music, etc will be in monotone (As though both speakers were playing the same thing instead of stereo quality. A big let-down for me since I'm gaming and chatting with my friends, though I circumvented this by using my laptop microphone instead of the headset's mic. Keep the clarity of the music/game while also chatting it up with my friends.2. ) The materials used for the headset are kinda cheap. After about 4 months of use (On average use about 6~10 hours a day, avid gamer) the right side mounting for the \"head adjustment\" that connects/adjusts the right earcup to the center headband, the plastic snapped from it causing the headset to loosely shift around and actually dislodge it from its track if you pulled it out far enough. This is remedied with Super Glue if not used very often, I tried repairing it myself with glue but didn't last very long. I still use it to this day without the fix and still works perfectly fine.3. ) The power button is a bit of a hassle, hold it down for about 3 seconds to power it on, hold it down for an additional 6 seconds to set it to pair with another device. If you don't pay attention while turning on your headset you might accidentally set it to pair with another device.4. ) The headset requires the use of a pairing password (0000), so those that have a bluetooth enabled sound jack for their CD player or other device that does not have some form for input for inputting the device password will not be able to. I do not have this type of device, and unable to go on further from it but I have ran into other reviews that others have had this same problem, and wanted to point that out here. (Just in case)5. ) The inability to use the headset while it is charging. Amazon.com or the original seller should have marked that in their description of the product.-------------Overall ::I love this headset, though I wouldn't really consider buying another one, but if it came right down to it, I would later on if I wasn't in a transition away from bluetooth headsets to Wireless 2.4ghz.  Love the clarity, the microphone is decent, if you can get past that it cuts the sound to mono from stereo.4/5 stars.

The sound quality was simply awful, with lots of hissing, static and distortion. It turns out that my Macbook's A2DP implementation is broken, or maybe doesn't jive with these headphones, because pairing the S805s with my iPhone resulted in much better sound.Later on, I switched to a Motorola Droid and the headphones perform are flawless in terms of interoperability. The volume and playback controls (call button and volume control on the left, play/pause button and forward/back on the right) all work as advertised and phone calls come in and go out loud and clear with the built-in microphone.These are not for the discriminating audiophile; sound quality is reasonable and adequate for casual use. Don't expect big bass or crystal-clear highs, but at reasonable volumes, audio playback is fairly free of noise and distortion.Without having a different model to compare to, I can only say that battery life is more than good enough for me. I use these headphones for a 3-5 hours every day at the office. I charge them once a week and have never had the batteries run out of juice on me. I like the fact that the headphones charge via USB, eliminating the need for yet another cumbersome wall-wart.All in all the S805s not what you would call a high-end product, but based on what I paid for them I could safely bet that better Bluetooth headphones could not be for twice the price.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2010", "summary": "Awesome BT headphones for the money"}

This was typically the experience...dial several times and maybe get a poor quality connection. Sometimes it never connects at all. Texting was very unreliable. Texts would arrive at the receiver's phone two days later in some instances. As if the poor quality wasn't enough, the reported minutes available was very inconsistent. It might tell you that you had 19 minutes remaining. You would then text or make a call and then it would tell you that you had 23 minutes remaining. Then all of a sudden you were out of minutes. So then you felt that you had to buy more minutes...but you weren't really sure. I bought a total of $140 of minutes and probably got about 5 minutes of clear talk time (that's $28 per minute...not much of a bargain!).

The phone's brand name is Ekit (not Nokia, Samsung, etc) and appears to be associated with Telestial. Received the phone, but have not been able to test it yet as I have not yet left. As others have indicated it does not work in the U.S. Surprised by how small it is. Keypad is also small. It does come with earbuds but the phone connector is not the usual 2.5mm but rather looks like some charger plugs. The charger handles all voltages, does plug in to a U.S. outlet and comes with an adapter for the two-pin European plug type (non-grounded). For the UK you will need your own adapter plug.The package comes with the Passport Lite SIM card. For those unfamiliar with GSM phones and SIM cards, they are two different things. The phone will have certain capabilities but the SIM card is the phone's identity and the SIM issuer defines the rules and costs of use. With this particular SIM card, which comes with USD $5 pre-loaded, you get both a UK number (common with rental phones) but also a US number, making it easier for people in the US to reach you without incurring international phone charges. Another nice feature is that voicemail is free but with this package there's a catch - it can only be accessed from the phone itself and not via either a special landline number or by calling the phone's number from a landline. Since this phone doesn't work in the U.S. this setup cannot be done until arrival in a country with 900/1800 GSM. If you are considering forwarding your phone to this phone's US number, it's best if you could set that up and test it before leaving. With a quad-band phone (Amazon offers one from Telestial that you could buy separately with this SIM card) this could be done.Outgoing calls are $0.99 per minute which can add up.

Please note when researching rates it is more expensive to call a UK mobile number which this is than a landline.- Sending texts to the US number will cost 15 cents.

The phone is little and easy to activate.  I got a US phone number as well as a British number from the SIM card which comes with $5 credit.  I got another $5 credit by going to [...] to set up a travel journal which is a neat thing to keep your friends posted about your travel.  I am also supposed to get $10 credit for writing a review.The morning that she arrived, I knew that she had made contact with my friend who was supposed to meet her there, by just looking at the calling history at the website.  The best thing is I can call her.  The first time the call didn't go through but it went through the second time.  The voice was clear.  The third time we got cut off after 6 minutes.All in all, I am very happy with the purchase.  I have so far called the British number and the incoming calls for her are free.  The US number, however, was charged 30 cents a minute but that number was called from France itself. I think they say you get 30 minutes for free when the US number is called from the US.I would highly recommend this phone for anyone who is going abroad and who wants to have a way to keep in touch.  The calls from abroad are expensive at 99c a minute but you can always call them back from here, which is a lot cheaper. It gives a peace of mind that you can always reach the traveling person.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2011", "summary": "Great little phone for the money"}

But this small surprised me; I thought it might be missing the full kit as directly sold by Telestial.  Yes, everything was all there; the unlocked phone, sim card, battery, recharger, and electrical adapter for Europe including written documentation pamphlets and a wallet sized quick reference card.  This no-frills cell phone clearly is designed for the frugal traveler.  Frugal because the vacation is not about telephoning on it every day to talk with the people back home; use the telephone at your lodging.  The phone's features and services provided deliver the essentials.  It's not about taking photographs with your cell phone.  Your brought your own and better digital camera for that.  Yet it includes a travel journal that is automatically updated and that you can manually update on the web with your camera pictures.  It's not about game playing and web-surfing but it does have texting too.  It's about a phone to place and receive a call when its necessary, an address book, and has voicemail.  These three are the most important to me; it has more and sensible features as well.  Such as fast dialing to essentials like local emergency services for the country that one is in, customer support, and either automatic or fast dial recharge of call minutes.  But that's not all, as goes the saying.The customer support by telephone is very good.  The people who answer your call are very knowledgeable and courteous; they are excellent.  You quickly get answers and the right ones.  Yet one needs to be prepared for heavy call volumes sometimes putting one on hold.  Were it not for that I would rate it overall excellent.  But it is not trying on one' patience as within a few minutes wait one gets through to a real person without playing voice menu maze.  And here they must be heralded for sensibly minimizing that nonsense.  One finds it much easier to wait when it takes at most two levels to get to someone.OK, what are the downsides?  Fine print.  No, not the legal stipulations.  It's that all the documentation provided is printed too small for these old eyes to read without strain.  Go to the web-site or call customer support when one's eyes give out.  And don't throw away anything that you get in that small box including what looks like advertising because it is useful sooner or later.  There is one other thing that could be better documented.  It's the free thirty minutes one can use to receive calls without being charged or charging the cost to the caller.  It took a telephone call to customer support to get it properly explained.

Bailey's review, I almost passed on this item.  I am SO glad I took a chance and bought it!  It does everything the spec's claim without a hitch.I'm using a desktop computer with powered USB port, one extended life battery (in the Q) and one standard size backup battery.  The charger AND data sync work fine with the same cable at the same time. (Not sure why Jay had so many problems with this unit - perhaps an underpowered USB port? This is covered in the documantaion as a footnote.)The snug fit of the Q in this charger base is a BIG plus!  I have used other chargers that had a looser fit and I often had to wiggle the Q to get it to line up with the mini USB plug inside the charger saddle - Not with this unit - It alignes perfectly and slides right in with one hand!This charger is also heavier than the products I've used in the past, which is really nice when using the Q, again with one hand, while in the charger - it stays put on the desk (as long as the rubber feet are dust free).One caution involving the battery indicator light:  When I inserted the Q and a spare battery at the same time, the indicator showed a flashing red light after 2 - 3 minutes.  The documentation describes this as a \"bad battery\" light.  But as soon as the Q was done charging, this light turned to a flashing green (\"charging\") and the battery charged without any problem.  The light turned to solid green when the spare battery was fully charged about an hour later.I give this product a 10!  It addressed all the reasons I bought it with flying colors: Data synce while charging in a nice, solid, attractive interface, able to charge Q and spare battery together, automatically, overnight without the use of a separate power supply and cable.  The one handed operation was a nice surprise.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2007", "summary": "Almost didn't - gald I did!"}

Krusell makes many more products that are compatible with the Blaze so that you can adjust it to your tastes or for whatever activity you need your phone for. The elastic strap on the bottom part of the case helps you to adjust the case to whatever length of cell phone you have and over time will stretch to suit the phone that you put in it. It also comes in a variety of colors to match your mood or lifestyle.Some of the drawbacks of the case are the interior lining, it tends to thread apart and you need to have a set of trimmers to keep the case from looking ragged. Another downside of the Blaze is the magnetic clasp, it sometimes will come undone and has a tendency to flop around. A stronger magnet would help that.

Yes, I know that the PC USB port will also charge the phone, but only while the PC is not sleeping.  Also you must turn the phone OFF to have it charge from a USB port, otherwise it just \"maintains\" the current charge.  And if you do turn it off, then it doesn't SYNC.  Then your PC goes into sleep mode and turns the power off to the USB port and guess what? The next day, dead battery!My Treo charger is MUCH better (and somebody put some thought into it) because you can plug BOTH the data cable (for syncing) AND the power cable for charging into the back of the charger for the Treo.  That way, it both syncs AND charges (even if your PC goes to sleep after syncing your data).  This is just a DUMB motorola design.One other option is plugging the charger into an outlet so that it does charge and syncing the Q using bluetooth, but if your PC doesn't have bluetooth....I'm hoping I can find another charger for this phone that does both.

Yeah, it requires a separate cable, but that's a minor point, since I always buy extra cables for business travels.One thing I'd like to clarify is that both charging and synchronization DO INDEED OCCUR when the docking station is connected to my notebook computer, so I completely disagree with one of the criticisms noted in J. Bailey's prior review. See my comments on that specific review for more specific details (i.e., click the \"Comment\" link below that review.)Some of the things that I really like about this dock are listed below:1) The upright position of the dock allows easy viewing of the phone's screen while charging. (Cable-only chargers usually force you to lay a phone flat on a table or desktop.)2) The tight fit of the phone in the docking station actually supports the phone well enough to allow typing of quick inputs without removing the phone from the dock and disconnecting the charge/sync process (e.g., answering a call using the speakerphone feature, dismissing or rescheduling a reminder... things that you don't really think about until an event occurs when the phone is connected and you have to quickly decide what to do).3) It accommodates both regular and extended-life batteries, and allows both the battery inside the phone and a spare battery outside of the phone to charge simultaneously. This is VERY important to me, since I use extended-life batteries, and I always carry a spare with me. So when I return home, I simply plug in the phone and pop my spare into the charging slot behind it. (Cable-only chargers usually only charge the single battery inside the phone, and don't have any way of easily accommodating spares.) If you only use a single battery and never remove the phone's battery cover (like a sealed iPod or iPhone), then this probably isn't an important consideration for you.One thing I've noticed after buying my Moto Q is that I eventually discarded protective skins as too impractical, because I often swap batteries throughout the day when one of them gets low. I eventually tossed all of the protective skins and now just use the phone as is, so the tight fit of the phone within the dock is not an issue for me. (I prefer it this way, since it provides better support when making quick inputs without disconnecting.)Bottom line: The more I use this little docking station, the more I appreciate some of the subtle design features that the Motorola engineers incorporated into it... features that I never actually considered when I originally purchased it.If this product came with a charging cable, I'd definitely give it 5 stars, but without a cable, it gets 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2007", "summary": "Very nice design...

It has large hinges at the bottom and the sliders along the side are a bit bulky for my taste. They could definitely be slimmed down. I immediately cut off the lanyard on mine; the ZVM is a bit heavy to use around the neck. The port for the earphones is a bit small; my non-OEM earphone plug is L-shaped and if it twists, it can come unseated. There is  an opening at the bottom, but the OEM adapter doesn't fit. Maybe the second party slim adapter will? The shaping over the buttons is a bubbly kind of pattern, and over time the pattern shows up on your player; I'd personally have liked it squared off arund the buttons.

The N82?  About 2 days of normal usage- camera, music, several calls, GPS, etc. Without charging via USB connection, it's good to have a car charger handy for emergency situations (that is, if you own a car).The DC-4 charger is just a basic car cigarette charger.  Plug it in and that's it!  Juice it up for about 30 minutes until you can get home for a full charger.  It has a green led indicator at the cigarette charger end letting you know it is charging your phone with electricity.  Leave it in your car under a hot summer sun?  No problem, and the plastic won't come apart exposing the inside wiring like some of the cheaper version.  This is the Nokia factory model, and I definitely recommend N82 users to invest in one.

The 3 megapixel camera takes brilliant pictures when your hand is steady. It has a built in flash which doubles as a flashlight. One huge annoyance that another reviewer mentioned was the fact that the phone doesn't save directly to your memory card. After taking a picture you have to manually transfer the file to the card. The built in MP3 player is great and plays loud through the stereo hands-free earbuds.Feel:It fits real nice in your hand and slides open with ease. It's a little light however, so it doesn't feel solid in your hand.Looks:Samsung has the market on the \"black-look\" for electronics. The phone is beautiful and slim but it doesn't have the shock factor as my other slim Silver Motorola SLVR (based on friend's reactions to phone). If Samsung were to came out with a silver edition, hands down this would be the best looking phone in its class.

The charger plugs into the lower right-hand side of the phone which makes it really difficult for righties (like myself) to type text messages with one hand while its charging. The space key is also at the lower right hand corner (the # key) which tends to put your thumb in an awkward position. I've been using Nokia and Ericsson phones for years so I'm not used to having to jerk my thumb all the way back to press the # key to type a space so when I'm tying long messages, my thumb sometimes cramps. I bought this phone cause my best friend has the earlier model and really likes it. She's a lefty!Another complaint I have is that it takes so much steps to send a text message. Unlike Nokia where you just select options, send, and select a contact from your address book, this one has 4 more steps. You have to select the address book, type in the 1st letter of the name, check it, select, then it'll ask you AGAIN if you want to send it. Sure it only takes 2 seconds longer, but its quite a bother when you're in a hurry.Another thing is that after it sends the message, it reverts back to the standby screen, so if you want to delete the message you just replied to, you have to go back into menu, messages, select it, and then delete. Again, it only takes a fraction of a second but its still a bother.This phone also doen't have timed profiles, or profiles at all for that matter. If you've never had a Nokia or another phone that has profiles then you won't miss it, but as someone who was very much dependent on timed profiles, its quite an adjustment not having it. And on that note, you can use an MP3 file as your ringtone but when it comes to message alert tones, you're limited to the ones that come with the phone which is a real bummer!PROS:The 3.13 Megapixel camera is pretty good for something so slim & small.The Bluetooth file transfer is quite fast even when transferring relatively large files. This is a blessing since I have to rely on bluetooth to transfer stuff to and from my laptop because the PC Suite that comes with it (obviously) isn't compatible to Macs - which is another CON, actually...I love the World Clock.I love the fact that you can save up to 3 Alarms. I have one for weekdays when i have to get up early, one for weekends when I can sleep in a little later, and I still have one for other occasions when i have to set an alarm for something or another without messing with the other 2.The Converter (currency, measurement, temperature, etc) is pretty handy though it isn't exactly the easiest thing to use. I still use it quite often. It beats having to manually compute everything.My Mom also like the fact that the screen is really big and you have the option to make the font of text messages HUGE so that she can still read messages even when her reading glasses are missing.All in all, I'd say its an 'okay' phone. Its definitely not as user friendly as Nokia or Ericsson, but the camera is pretty good and my complaints are all relatively minor and easy to work around or get over so if you're used to Samsung phones, go for it! You won't have to adjust that much. If you're a Nokia user, then just make sure you're ready to live life without times profiles and personalized sms alert tones.I hope this helps!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2006", "summary": "Phone for Lefties"}

First, I stand by all of the comments I made below, but change my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This phone works great. There are problems, but those come inherent with its best feature, the extremely compact size, i.e. small buttons and getting dropped a lot. Reception is great and sound is great. Mine has taken quite a beating while I got used to keeping hold of such a small phone, and still looks and works like new. I did put a screen protector over the screen, so that helps with keeping scratches away. After a couple months I have gotten used to the small buttons and mildly quirky interface and neither bother me at all anymore. I use it more than I had planned, but still have a long ways to go before an annual contract would be better. This phone is one decision that comes with no regrets.2 week review:I got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review.First, the qualifier. I have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. I don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either, I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.The GoodSize is great. This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width, but shorter. It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky.  It makes a razr feel thick, but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr.The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. It also has good reception. Sprints network is not the best in my area, but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar.When I was in the car, the road noise got too loud to hear, but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine, and keep my hands on the wheel.Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. I expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year, including the $50 up front for the phone. The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. Although I haven't tried them, it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level.Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys. Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it, it also looks like a real piece of equipment. As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP. (in vibrate mode of course) At the same time, my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool.The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for \"my account,\" a dragon for \"messaging,\" etc. Other than that, the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive.Can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks, but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine.The BadPerhaps because they are affordable in other ways, Virgin screws you on ringtones and background. The four ringtones included are unacceptable, and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop, but none of them sound like a phone.  The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too, so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well.The buttons are a little too small. Most of the time I do fine, but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I haven't run into that problem any more.Battery life has not lived up to what I read, but that might be because of how I use it. If I charge it every night I am fine. I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case.SummaryAfter two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. It is not big on extras like a camera, but what it does it does well. Virgin uses Sprint's network, see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone.

It doesn't have a camera, but does have basic online connection to Virgin, allowing for software downloads.  There are some useful tools included such as alarm clock, stop watch, calendar, etc.  Few basic background pictures and ringtones are included as well.Regardless of other reviews, the phone is NOT flimsy (although may feel like it at first), the keypad is easy to use (even with big hands like mine), the reception is good (not great, but competes with most other phones), and the volume/tone (incoming and outgoing) is excellent.  The volume/tone may take some getting used to as it transmits more midrange frequency than most phones, this in turn makes the speach sound more realistic, but may take a minute to get used to.It is fairly easy to use, but I would recommend glancing at the manual for some useful functions and shortcuts.  The Virgin customer service is easy, readily available, and personnel are informed and helpful.The downside to the phone is that it does feel on the flimsy side at first, but the phone can take a beating without even a scratch.  The menu is somewhat different from most other cell phones, but is easy to get used to.In closing, this is a $50 phone, not a $300 Blackberry, so don't expect a Porche for the price of a Geo.

I've been pleased with it, though it is a change from what I was used to. I don't think the interface is as user-friendly as the Vox, though it does look more attractive!As mentioned in other reviews, the preloaded ringtones suck even more than the backgrounds do, and having downloaded a couple \"Song\" ringtones, aka actual music when the phone rings... it's hit and miss as far as sound quality with that speaker on the back, since there is a lot of distortion at very high volumes.One of the things I can't get over is the way the menu's set up. You can choose from a vertical alignment of the menu options, or a grid. On the Vox, the grid lined up perfectly with the keypad, so once you figured out what symbols went to which screen, it was a breeze figuring out which button to press to get to it. Not the Slice. The grid layout of the menu has a meaningless little Virgin Mobile graphic where the 5 key would be, so all the keys after that 5th grid symbol are moved up, therefore making it difficult to figure out which button you need to press.The buttons CAN be hard to press. I sometimes have a difficult time with the 2/Back/down key... they're so close together. You really have to use your fingertips to use this phone.Other than that, if you're looking for just a phone phone, it's a great thing. As a college student who doesn't do much texting and hates video phones, it's great for me. I haven't had any battery problems - unless it's searching for a signal. Then the battery life is SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. I found this to be the case with the Vox as well. Taking the phone to a class that happens to be in the basement of a building with no reception, and trying to leave it on, drains the battery fast. So if you're going to not have a signal for a while, I just suggest turning it off and saving yourself the headache.I'd give it a higher rating, but I really liked my Vox better.

I still have this phone and am still pretty satisfied with it. One thing, though, about the phone heating up. If a phone call goes on too long, it does grow hot. I mean hot! I don't normally use it for long calls, but the few times my conversations have lasted for more than a few minutes, the Slice feels like it's burning up in my hand. I wonder if it might burn the circuitry inside the phone one of these times.***Not so good points:It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk). ADDED COMMENT: Two years later and I still haven't lost it.Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the \"3\" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use. ADDED COMMENT: The button did get broken in and now it's a breeze to turn on and off.All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2007", "summary": "Good deal, basic phone, and the red Slice is pretty ta boot (ADDED COMMENTS after two years)"}

The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones.Now, the badButton size, battery life, built in extras.The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone.

Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let's start with the positives:-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage).-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).On the downside:-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2007", "summary": "Affordable, compact phone"}

I use the foam cover, it seems to keep it in place better. My ears are small so I don't use the wrap around piece because it's too loose.I bought this model because of its size, mainly. I've seen people with HUGE pieces looking very sci-fi-y and that's just not my thing. I wanted something small and cute, and then what do you know?! It comes in hot pink too!!When I got it I paired it with my Samsung C417, and I connect it and disconnect it whenever I want. Connecting it takes less time than it would if I was hooking the phone up with a corded headset (which I used to do whenever I got in the car and was about to drive).

Surprisingly enough, even with the release of the coolest phones around (i.e. the iPhone), I still receive compliments about the phone about its slim and sleek design.I mentioned \"fall endurance\" and \"scratch resistance\" as its pros because I have a horrible tendency of dropping my cell phone from places such as my pocket or my purse. For instance, just yesterday, I dropped my cell phone down a staircase of some 10 steps. I surely thought it wouldn't survive that fall, but it did! As for its scratch resistance, yes, it's still pretty in black and functional after the (I swear) 20 falls it has endured over the past year.Another important thing that I have learned from using this cell phone is what I want from the next cell phone that I upgrade to.I remember when I first got this cell phone I was initially disappointed with its low-resolution display and I still find myself still frustrated after all these months, especially when I see how awesome my friends' cell phones' screens are like, so crisp and sharp and clear.And it's true that this phone has low picture quality. Most pictures I take in a spontaneous moment ends up being lost and blurry. It's disheartening, really. You have to have a steady hand or else. Not to mention, I'm a photographer at heart, so I'm just plain picky when it comes to picture quality anyway.This phone is often confused with its older brother, the Motorola L7 which has iTunes capability. This one doesn't, although I somehow managed to have enough space in my phone to nearly download a full John Mayer song as my ringtone. But, make no mistake, I downloaded the song from a friend's cell phone (he has the SYNC with BlueTooth capability and all those fancy things). Oh, but this phone does have BlueTooth; I'm just not a fan of that usage, that's all.Poor speakerphone quality is a fact in this phone, which is a feature I use often. I find myself repeatedly asking \"What?!\" when talking to my boyfriend or whoever it is that is on the other line. Oh! I also find that when talking normally into the phone, that after hours of a conversation, the heat of the phone radiates through my ear and makes it uncomfortable.Poorly designed keypad? Oh, yes. I really don't know what makes it such of a discomfort, but it's there. Maybe it's because the keypad curves? Or maybe because there's that divide for each key? Eh, no idea, but it does bug the heck out of me and STILL does.So, take my advice: after a year, the only reason you would get this phone is because of its functionality, period. Maybe you're a parent who wants their kid to have a phone that makes and receive calls. Or maybe you're someone who's starting out and don't know what they quite want yet in a phone and can't decide until you actually have it in your hand. Well, guess what? I'm BOTH! Except, well, I was the kid.But, yeah, I'm ready to upgrade after A YEAR with this phone. I'm doing my research, and thus far, I'm leaning towards the Motorola RIZR Z3 (Rose).Hope this helps.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2007", "summary": "Keyword: Functionality"}

(I just tell it to call a name in my cellphone directory, and it does the rest!)The price is reasonable for what this does.It's one of the few devices of this type that has a big display area for the phone number, HOWEVER...(see CONS below)...It's easy to operate!It seems to hold a full charge for a long time period (at least a week so far for me).CONS:It only comes with a 30 day warranty!It needs to be charged for 2-4 hours when the battery drains. The problem is, the ONLY way they suggest you charge it is through your vehicle's cigarette lighter. (No adapter to charge it in our home.) And they suggest NOT charging it when you aren't in your vehicle. I don't know about you, but I seldom drive around town for 2-4 hours. (FYI, I just left it plugged in while I was at home and all worked well.)The \"log\" area is supposed to keep track of calls in and out by way of logging them with a 0-5 first digit in front of them so you know which calls were most recent. The unit I have puts no such digit in front of the number. And there are some mysterious numbers in the log I have no idea who they belong to which DO have a #1 in front of all of them. (There are no 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbered calls to be found! All the \"mystery\" numbers have a \"1\" in front of them.)While this unit DOES have a large display area for the number, it's hard to see in bright light.Hope these PROS/CONS help you to decide if you want to purchase it. Would I buy it again? Yes, I think I would. Mainly because I believe the pros outweigh the cons...especially the fact that it really DOES work for hands-free calling.

Using it for long periods kind of hurts my hand, too.Another drawback that some may find rather minor is the clip slid off a few times. Nothing really keeps it in place other than the tension from squeezing the barrel, although slipping it back on is easy. If this bothers you enough, you could possibly look into gluing it in place or something.It's still a decent pen if you don't care about a ballpoint tip, and I still find the design pretty cool. Eventually I settled for a Lamy fountain pen, which has its share of pros and cons as well.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2011", "summary": "A Rather Neat Pen"}

Fadhley \"Salim Fadhley\"", "helpful": [5, 5], "unixReviewTime": 1201046400, "reviewText": "Nokia have managed to fix nearly all of the BH-501's flaws - the 601 is a substantially better product in almost every way. Unfortunately Nokia have introduced a range of new problems, which I am sure they will get round to fixing ... in a year or so.The first major improvement is that it's tougher. Nokia have eliminated both of the weak-spots in the bendy plastic adjacent to the earphones. The curves around the earphones of the BH-601 are sturdy bars of flexible plastic with shock-absorbing rubber inserts. They have the appearance of being able to withstand a great deal of twisting and bending. That's good news because I have a feeling that I will get more than a few weeks use out of this device.The next major improvement is obvious - they've added a few more buttons. Not quite as many as Jabra with their confusing  BT620s, but enough to allow some nifty new features. In addition to the original volume controls and select/power button we now have a track-skip controller.Oddly enough the volume controls work in a different way to those on the BH-501. They do not seem to be linked into the phone's volume control. The two act independently rather than (as with the BH-501) change a single volume setting.Another neat feature is that for the first time Nokia have noticed that nobody likes to be lit up like fairy-lights. This device has two LEDs adjacent to the standard Nokia charging port. The blue light blinks to show that the headset is active and the green light blinks when the headset is on charge. There are no lights visible from the side or front. That's good news for people who do not wish to be the focus of attention.It never occurred to me to complain that the BH-501 could not operate while charging. It just seemed like too small a thing to mention, but that's another thing that Nokia have changed. I'm not sure that I'd ever want to talk while charging as having a charging wire plugged into a headset somewhat negates the benefit of a wireless device. It's nice they thought of it though, I can confirm that it works.And now the bad points: The reception range of the BH-601 seems to be considerably worse than the BH-501 (which was excellent). In ideal circumstances the BH-601 will give me 10 metres of range from my Nokia 95 while listening to stereo audio. In an environment with moderate to low levels of radio interference (e.g. a normal city street) the signal will often break down unless I hold the N95 almost adjacent to the headset. I guess the thicker plastic used to make this device absorbs a lot more of the signals.Speaking of range, a related issue is the device's ability to recover from an interrupted signal. Unfortunately it's not good. As I wandered around my office building today, I noticed that somebody operating a photocopier nearby was enough to interrupt the signal. Also the motor which opens the steel gate of the cycle-park put out enough EMF to completely cut the connection.While a brief interruption may be acceptable in the face of interference, the problem with this device is that once it looses a connection the the link stays lost. The only way to re-connect is to power-down the headset, and then re-boot it. The phone appears not to have detected the fact that the link has failed resulting in complete silence.Another oddity is that this stereo headset seems to switch to monaural mode every time a call comes in. A phone call is always in mono but one of the advantages of having a headset with 2 earphones is that you can hear the mono audio with two ears at once. When you use the BT-601 to talk on the phone only the left can produces sound. The right can (which includes the microphone) remains silent.It's also worth noting that the look and styling of this product seems quite cheap. It's a better design than the BH-501 but the quality of the plastic molding is poor, and the silvery insert in either of the phones looks very cheap. That's sad because I would have been willing to pay slightly more for a device that has a more elegant design.On the whole the BH-601 is a modest improvement on the ill fated BH-501. It's definitely the best Nokia stereo headset I've tried but they still have a long way to go before they deliver the headset I really deserve.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2008", "summary": "Flawed improvement over the BH-501"}

Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card, as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory.Once you are well versed with what your phone can play, i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer, this saves you a chunk of time and battery power.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2007", "summary": "There is a feel good thing about this....I am sure you will agree with my conclusion...read on"}

I love the design of the headset and I love the way that it stays in your ear without needing an ear hook (allowing for glasses to be worn).  But that's about where the loving ends.  I've used this headset and have asked others how I sounded and have even called and left myself a voicemail (in a variety of environments).The results were mixed ranging from I could be heard to being asked to repeat myself.  The problem is that the microphone points down as opposed to pointing towards your mouth.  If they were to position the microphone so that it is directed closer towards your mouth - that would hopefully improve being heard by other callers.  In terms of how callers sounded to me - the earphone could use a bit of a boost as it's just loud enough to hear (even at it's max volume).  Maybe it's my phone and phone OS (I have an AT&T; tilt and windows mobile 6) and bluetooth version (the headset is 1.2 and my phone is 2.0).  Hopefully if the company comes out with an updated version (and not just additional colors) they'll make it bt 2.0 or BT 2.1 and will increase the loudness of the earphone (I think it is the design of the ear clicks that are used to hold the headset in place.  They don't allow for the speakerphone to get close to the ear canal to get as much sound as possible).Overall - if you're looking for a headset that can be worn with glasses then this is your headset (as long as you use it inside of your home).  If you're looking for a headset that can be worn with glasses AND provides optimal performance then look elsewhere (where that is I don't know).  If you're looking for a headset period - if you get this - don't expect much out of it - else look elsewhere (where I don't know as this is a sad state for bluetooth headsets.  There's not ONE that is THE IT headset).I hope this helps.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2008", "summary": "Okay but could be better"}

I really wanted a metal case for my phone, but I also wanted one that encased the entire thing (Otterbox style without the inflated price). This is the most attractive option that I found (I even waited until they released the black one) and I really do love the feel that it gives the phone. If you've made the decision to get the Note 2 you don't mind bulk, and I always felt that the material and weight of the phone didn't fit what it should be. The case adds a good deal of weight to the phone and the metal has a really nice feel to it. The problem is of course the design, like every other reviewer has mentioned. The idea of making this thing a clasp complete with a protruding hinge rather than just a front plate that slides on seems brain dead. However, I have not experienced issues with the clasp not holding and I am constantly using and moving around my phone. Also, I got used to it really quickly and don't feel it really impedes the use of the phone, especially considering you are supposed to hold the Note 2 with two hands.

All the signs pointed to a great product. I went with this as opposed to another manufacturer because I wanted to stick with the Nokia brand. The pairing to my Nokia N75 was problematic at first, but that was only because I didn't do it correctly. Read the directions on how to do it. The build quality of this is exceptional. It doesn't creak like my new BH-602 does when you grab it. This headset along with my N75 are both bluetooth 2.0 so things sounded great while talking to people, and the range is good. Walking 20 feet away with a wall in between the phone and I, there was a little static, but I expect that with bluetooth. Sound quality is very good on all calls. People sounded very clear. However, volume wise, it could be louder. That's the only thing I saw as a downside, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. All buttons are easy to press and locate, so no worries there. Battery life on this is amazing considering the battery size. I get 7 days usage out of single charge on about 3 hours of calls with multiple disconnections and connections from my phone. I let it sit for 11 straight days, and it still had a charge, so I was VERY impressed. The specs say 9.17 days of standby time. This will beep if the battery is starting to get low also. The weight of this may be an issue for those looking to wear this for more than 2 hours, but maybe it's just me. It's not a heavyweight, but you will feel it. It's a shame that this product simply didn't fit my ear. The only time it ever did was when I had a beanie on and it was smashed into my ear. You can bend the earloop to your liking to secure it on your ear, but if you have a small ear opening, this probably won't be a good fit. If this were an in-ear design like a lot of others, it would be excellent for me. But for someone else, it might be a great solution.

You have to press 5 buttons to dial the previously missed call. 8 buttons to get to voicemail. What?Then of course, other functions are TOO easy to get to. Like firing up the web browser. Yeah, that's one touch and it's easy to accidentally press that button. Of course if you do, you get charged like 20 cents a second - a costly mistake that adds up.But if that's not enough, you can't add information to an address entry without starting over and creating a new contact. It's insane. But if you want to add another phone number, unique ring tone, etc.....well, you can't because you there is no \"save\" option for the SIM card when you're editing. I bet several of my friends they couldn't save a ringtone to their name. No one could (and these are people who are tech-savvy and all work in the tech industry).

Now, I'm waiting the four hours for the battery to die (4 hr battery life - one of the few good things about this phone) so that the software can reset.

I had my husband call me when he was driving the same two roads and he didn't even experience interference.

I fell in love with the look of the SLVR but I still felt like I needed to look into it and compare with other phones.  I read all of the reviews, good, bad and ugly and decided, for my needs, this was the phone for me.So far, this has been a great choice!  The phone itself is very attractive and I was able to find a case specifically made for the L7's that enhanced this even more, instead of hiding it behind some bulky material.  I have no problems with the reception and can always hear clearly and be heard clearly.The biggest disappointment I had was that I couldn't figure out how to assign individual ringtones and assumed this this was not an option of the phone rather than being the outcome of the ill-informed user that I was.  Reading other reviews showed that this was a disappointment for other users as well.  WE WERE WRONG!  My best advice: READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL!  But to sum it up, to get an individual ringtone, a number has to be saved to the phone rather than the SIM card.  So this is no longer a disappointment for me.For those of you who get this phone through Cingular/AT&T;, the phone comes with a memory card (nice bonus!) and I was able to find another micro memory card with more storage and 2 micro card adaptors (to fit the micro in other memory card slots) for just over $13 on Amazon.  I do not use the iTUNES feature (as of yet) but have put music on my card and played it through the \"my sounds\" function, which has worked great for me.I have seen complaints about the keypad and have found them, for myself, to be unfounded.  I have no problems with them.  However, I do not text a lot, but when I have, the functions have been easy to use and unconfusing.The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the quality of the camera.  Pictures are a little blurry and dark.  Since this is not my primary sourse of photos, this is not a huge disappointment for me.For my use, this phone is fantastic, but bear in mind that I am pretty easy on my cell phones, with a little less than an average amount of use.

After spending WAY too much time on the phone with Cingular in a long and drawn out \"upgrade\" request and after being promised the phone twice and having it not shipped as promised, I had about reached the point of switching carriers and stopping the torture.  But, I finally got my phancy pink phone and it was worth the wait.  Where to start?  How about with one thing at a time, which is how I managed the learning curve on this pheature laden phoneAddress Book:  It is huge.  And ... I was able to move the card from my nokia so I did not have to rebuild my address book, and I absolutely love the one button, voice call feature, though there is a limit to how many names can be loaded in.  The button is conveniently located on the right side of the phone, just say the pre-recorded name clearly and that number will be dialed for you automatically.  I use this a LOT.  Recording the name took a bit of practice, but gets much easier.iTunes:  I selected this phone not just because of the color, but primarily because of the built-in iPod.  I am a daily bus rider it seemed to make more sense than the cumbersome CD player that required batteries once a week and the awkward changing of disks - not to mention a LOT more space in my purse.  The download was really pretty easy, but I had been using iTunes on home computer for some time so I had a familiarity with the program.  Sounds as good as the CD player ever did, and the shuffle songs feature gives a nice variety of about 100 songs - way nicer than the CD player.  A phone call will interrupt the play, but then the music will go right back to where it was.  I can also listen to tunes without using the headphones, which I find handy on my morning bike rides.  The speaker is just loud enough but I can still hear traffic and I'm not being too noisy.  The model phone I have will not allow you to take an iTune song and make it a ringtone.Camera/Videocam:  I did not expect to use this feature very much but it has come in quite handy.  Setting it up to be able to e-mail the pictures/videos was a real hassle and there is a charge (but Cingular is patient and persistent), but using the cameras is very easy.  Actually my 9 and 10 year old nieces have taught me everything I could possibly need to know, and have a delightful time making 20 second videos (see mamalinde on youtube for some delightful examples of their genius).  Easy to make a picture into a screensaver too, right now it is a pink peony.Mobile e-mail.  This feature is a good one to have, but a bit cumbersome and slow.  It took over an hour on the phone with Cingular to get this set up but we finally got there.  I get a notification beep everytime I get an e-mail, which is a bit distracting even with a good junk philter on that address.  And the attachments, links don't work on the phone.  It is nice to be able to confirm that an e-mail arrived or to check what may be stacking up when you can't get to a computer.Text messaging.  Okay, get past it.  Not just for teens and young folks, if this gramma to text message, so can you.  Besides better manners than talking it offers a bit more privacy when riding the bus or out in a crowd, and sometimes a reminder in writing is much more effective and can be stored if referring back is necessary.  If your kiddo can't talk right now, you can STILL communicate with them!  The Quick Note feature, where you can store repetitious messages (check e-mail, thank you, ok, call me, where are you, yes and no), this is very very handy and quick.  And sending and receiving sweet nothings with the phella, well, that will keep you young.Ringing/Vibrating.  Using this feature is easy.  Just the up and down sound buttons on the upper left portion of the phone will move you from ringing volumes to vibrate (or silent).IM.  I haven't used this yet.  Hmmm.  Maybe it will be next?Internet.  This can be customized to your demands, mine gives me local weather and news.  I find it hard to search for something specific, but it is very handy to have access to news stories or the weather radar.  Maybe I should play with this a bit more?In sum I have used this phone for several months now and find it quite worthy of a Princess like me.  It has also been dropped a couple of times onto cement, with no harmful effect except for some scratches on the pink paint.  The petite size is phenomenal, especially considering all the pheatures and it's a showstopper too.

In retrospect I probably shouldn't have bought a glass phone for an 11 year old boy but the features were just unbeatable. Well, that pretty glass front lasted a good three or four hours before it got cracked - not broken, just a spidery crack that was getting worse, so it needed to be protected. (side note: I've heard replacement glass for these phones is not shatterproof, so it's best to stick with your original glass if it's not too badly cracked). Just protect it.Anyway, this fits perfectly on the phone, just snap it on. The part of the case that covers the body has a clip  that makes it bulky, but if you don't want the clip part, the front cover does what really needs to be done, which is to protect that delicate glass face. Apparently there are other cases where (if you do use the back part) it covers the KRZR's speakers, this one is not one of those, you can still hear the speakerphone and music fine.The cracks, which ran the full length of the screen, have not gotten worse at all since we got the cover, it is very effective at keeping pressure away from the glass even under challenging conditions (tweenage boy's pockets). And since we just use the top, it hardly interferes with the beauty of the KRZR at all. And it's cheap!

It is actually an adapter with a built in microphone and volume control, with seperate stereo earbuds included (if you don't like the headphones you can use most stereo headphones with the adapter.)The earbuds are average quality, useable but not exceptional. Yes, one earplug cord is actually longer than the other by intentional design. (Many people are annoyed by the cord dangling in front of them, so some headphones are now made so that the cord for one plug goes behind your head, and then over your shoulder. If this bothers you, throw them away and buy a pair that you like, the headphones are just cheap junk anyway.) The real value is in the adapter, which can be used with any stereo headphones with a 3.5mm mini stereo plug.It could also be used with car stereo adapters, although I haven't checked for microphone feedback (squeal) yet. If you do hook it up to your car stereo I would advise turning the volume down before you try answering your phone, and be sure you try it out while you're parked.

It is a two-piece unit. The \"important\" piece is a male 4 conductor stereo headset connection (2.5mm) for a cell phone on one end and a female 3.5mm standard 3-conductor headphone jack on the other end. The female jack side is larger than a simple cable jack because it includes a built-in microphone and a button, which is called a Turbo Button on my Sanyo's display. There is a spring-loaded clip on this end, such that you could attach it to your shirt or even to your seat belt shoulder strap. End to end, this piece is approximately 35\" (89mm), which is sufficient for me to put my phone in my pants pocket/clip or in a cup holder in my car while the clip is midway on my chest.The other part of the two-piece unit is a functional traditional ear-bud style headset with a standard 3.5mm male plug. I suppose as a mnemonic for the headset, L-e-f-t is shorter than R-i-g-h-t. The headset has relatively short length, which is good for this purpose. From plug tip to the ear piece-split strain relief is approximately 12\". Strain relief to Left is approximately 8\", and strain relief to Right is approximately 18\". Yes, this is not a typo. The right earbud cable is longer than the plug cable. While adequate for the purpose of the combination headset/adapter, it'll probably not be as convenient to use the headset portion for most other applications.(I suppose that it's likely these dimensions will vary slightly with your purchase).The big selling point of this unit is that it allows you to use your own headset with your multimedia phone. I should note that this works wonderfully with my Sanyo SCP8400. Recently, I had upgraded my stock car stereo with one that accepts MP3 3.5mm connections. I hooked the connection to my phone via the LG adapter and now I have my phone in my car hands-free and actually (IMO) safer than a headset. With my specific phone, I now have my mp3s able to be played through my car stereo (or I can subscribe to Sirius or other music channels via the phone) and can answer the phone with limited interruption.In conversations with friends, the sound quality of the connection was good (so they tell me), and the sound quality for voice in my stereo was very nice. The conversations are clear and I'm told little or no echo to the other end of the conversation. Unfortunately, when I was not actively using the headset while connected to my stereo in AUX (at least, this is my experience with my setup), there was a periodic \"click\" that is otherwise inaudible. This isn't a reflection on this product, however. This is more likely either my phone or stereo/phone combination that is encountering the issue. Since it's rather pointless to have the stereo on in my car without \"something\" playing (radio, cd, or mp3s from the phone), I'll chalk this one up to \"user workaround.\"If you have a stereo multimedia cell phone and are starting to carry around your mp3s in your phone via micro sd versus your ipod, this is not a bad purchase, especially if you consider the possibility of using your phone's music in almost any of the mp3 speaker systems (i-Dog?), or even use your cell phone's mp3s through your stereo system in-house. With audio streaming in some multimedia phones, you have new entertainment options and flexibility to hear them however you want -- and answer the phone.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2007", "summary": "More versatile than you think."}

As an added bonus, there is a built-in microphone on the adapter that allows you to take phone calls if they come in while you're listening to your music-with this added circuitry, the volume is a little bit lower in comparison to the headphones you get with the Verizon Music Package for $30 that includes a transfer cable, Windows software and headphones.

Previously I had to carry an mp3 player separate from my cell phone. I listen to my player all the time, so a good quality pair of comfortable earphones was a necessity.Unfortunately, most hybrid headsets have lousy uncomfortable earphones that sound like crap.Then I found this headset. What a wonderful concept! A 2.5mm stereo headset plug that ends with a microphone and a jack that allows me to plug my own earphones into it. Unfortunately there were several issues.The biggest problem is the pinout. When I first plugged it in, it played music in the right ear only and the microphone didn't function. I came to find out that the pinout for the palm devices is different than the pinout on LG and other so-called \"standard\" devices. But for the price and the anticipated gain I decided it would be worth re-wiring them.For those palm users who are looking at these I'll post below exactly what I did. But for review sake I'll continue on the product...Once I was able to change the wiring to go along with Palm's methods I found it to work out just perfectly.The set comes with it's own earphones which are about the same quality as those you get with a phone or mp3 player - or in other words, junk worthy of nothing more than a backup in the glove box for worst case scenarios or sharing with a passenger. But I didn't buy this for the earphones. I bought it to plug my Koss earphones into. This works just right. The microphone is not excessively heavy and has a clip on it to attach to a collar or shirt. The jack is sturdy and the plug from my earphones stays in nicely with no additional static or noise from moving around. The microphone provides clear voice even in my convertible with the top down. Pushing the button while the music is playing when no call is coming in activates the voice command built into the phone and allows me to voice dial, pushing it when the phone is ringing answers the call and pushing it while on a call disconnects the call - all without ever having to touch the phone. There is a small volume wheel on the microphone part as well to control the volume to the earphones.As for the cons, the cord from the plug to the microphone could really use and extra foot or two. The length is about 2.5 feet - maybe 3 - I never measured it. My re-wiring only took about half an inch off the total length. Still, in the end, the goal was to spend less than $10 and be able to use my own earphones which after my modification works flawlessly. If you don't have a palm product it should be very nice. If you do, it can still work, but with the following modifications....OK. Here's how I modified it. The problem is that on a palm device, the tip of the plug, pin one, is the microphone. Pin 2 is the right ear, and pin 3 is the left channel. On the LG - or any other \"standard\" hybrid headset, pin one is the left channel, pin 2 is still the right earphone, and pin 3 is  the left earphone.The solution is to cut the cord about 4-6 inches above the plug. This will give you extra wire if you make mistakes. It will also keep the heat away from the microphone section.Carefully strip about an inch and a half from both parts where you cut the wire. Inside you will see red, green, and blue wires along with some bare copper. The bare copper is your ground. The colors are a thin insulator that is semi-transparent.Next you will need to tin the ends of the wires. Use a soldering iron to burn off the insulator. Use a lot of flux to do this. It will cause  the stuff to liquify and drip and you will have to clean your iron several times. After this, use some more flux and some rosin core solder. Get the solder on the tip of the iron and then carefully drag the tip of each wire through the solder several times till it is a nice silver color.Once you have the wires prepared, you simply connect them. The copper and copper go together. The red goes back to the red as they are the right channel which is fine. The blue and green get swapped. Blue to green and green to blue. Hold each pair that you want to connect together facing each other just as they were before you cut it but overlapping where the soldered ends are. Then briefly touch this overlapped portion to the iron and they will solder together.Next, get some electrical tape about 1 inch long and cut it in half down the middle. Use this to put a small wrap around each wire where it is soldered so you don't cause any shorts. Then wrap the whole thing in shrink wrap or electrical tape. I used a white tape to look nicer.Now your headset should function properly on a palm device.I hope this helps other palm users I looked all over for this info and pretty much had to wing it. Maybe I can at least save some other people some time.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2008", "summary": "Doesn't work for Treo 750 or other palm devices"}

It may have the words, \"works for all LG phones with 2.5 mm jacks,\" on the package, but that's just marketing strategy in order for LG to get you to buy this headset for their phones, but I used it for my Motorola RAZR V3m (with an adapter), and it worked better than the Motorola headset that came with the Vcast Music Essentials that I bought years ago.The 3.5 mm jack, located next to the mic, is very convenient if you don't want to use LG's earbuds that come with this headset. I didn't have that same freedom with the Motorola headset. The 3.5 mm jack will, of course, let you plug in any kind of headphones as well as computer speakers, which is a great option if you want to put on music at a friend's or if you have a little party at the spur of the moment. It also works for a tape converter if you have a cassette player in your car. If someone calls you on the road, you can use your car's speakers as the earpiece while driving, but you need to talk into the mic for the other person to hear you, so I wouldn't recommend using your car's speakers as the earpiece. It's great for listening to music on your phone and is actually quite decent for listening to music in your car, though iPods sound better in your car as they give a better thump with the bass. (I've compared several mp3s, unchanged, with both my phone and iPod)The mic has a button on it that answers calls so that you don't have to go to your phone to answer the call, which is typical with cell phone headsets. It has a volume dial on the side, again, so you don't have to go to your phone each time you want or need to turn up/down the volume of music or someone talking to you. It also has a clip on it that rotates so that you can position the mic in any direction that you'd like. I'm always rotating it, and the rotation hasn't gotten loose to this day. I've had the product for a few months now.As other reviewers have noted, the earphone's cord is shorter on the left side, but long enough on the right side to reach around your neck to your other ear with room to spare. I don't care for that, but I got this headset specifically so I don't have to use the standard earphones that LG provides, so I'm not going to rate this any lower.The length of the cord of the headset and earphones is near 6 feet, with the earphones about 2 feet in length on their own. If you use a different set of headphones, then it's likely that the whole thing will be even longer! A lot of cord can be messy, especially if you have the phone in your pocket... the cord will hang down past your knees if you're using a different pair of headphones. I'm still not rating this product any lower because I just keep the excess cord tucked under my shirt.If you're like me and want flexibility to using different kinds of headphones to listen to music, but still want a mic for calls, then I recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2008", "summary": "Works for ANY phone with a 2.5 mm jack.

I found it!  I LOVE having sound in both ears. I solved the \"earbuds fall out of my ears\" problem (and they do) by attaching ear gels from a different headset product. Also, and this is huge: with the combination of turning up the phone volume and the headset volume (there's a tiny dial in the dangling microphone piece), I can actually hear!  So many headsets are too quiet for me, and this one actually can get too loud, even with all the road noise from my car! I'm thrilled. And even with earphones in both ears I can still hear the traffic around me in case there's an emergency.Having the R cord longer than the L cord is a different experience, but once I figured out that I had to wrap the R cord behind my neck it all worked out. I think the idea is that it minimizes the number of cords tangling in front of you while you're talking.My one complaint is that the microphone doesn't have the best voice quality, and if you don't have it clipped up near your chin people won't be able to hear you. People tell me that my voice quality is kind of harsh and digitized, as though the overtones aren't coming through. But so far everyone has been able to understand me perfectly, so I'm not going to worry about it.--> update 10/2011 -- I finally got tired of clipping the microphone to my chin (I clipped it to a long rubberband that I hung over both ears... yes, this looked dorky, you can see why I eventually got sick of it... and I switched to a different headset.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010", "summary": "Finally, I can hear!!"}

So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first.  And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized.  I love this headset.  Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music.  And no, the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular, but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music.  I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls.  So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros:+Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as you'd like and then some. I couldn't hear one of my friend's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number (press once), say a voice command (hold button), or hang up the call (press once again) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car! (Details below)+Lightweight. Could be used for running with the right headphones. I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire. The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk. Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons (of course)-Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it isn't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length.  Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone.  Cannot mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual.  I love this headset more than any bluetooth I've ever bought.  And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car.  Well, I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players.  I was on the road and I didn't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset, inserted the tape, turned up the volume, and made a call.  It worked perfectly!  I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers.  The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone.  But the best part was that the headset wasn't clipped to me, it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different.  My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well.  I'll try to remember to update when I know for sure.  Trust me, if you're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt.

Lets clear some things up. First, these headphones come in TWO peices, which means the stereo headset and microphone sections are separate. The headphones are awful, extremely tinny with no bass, but who cares, because the key feature of these is that you can connect YOUR OWN headphones to the mic part of this headset! Thats worth the price alone, as far as I'm concerned. I use these with the LG VX 8300, and they work great.The connector on these is a 3 band, meaning there are 4 contacts. LG programs their adapters in this fashion: mic(tip),L ,R, Ground(base). Almost every other company does it mic, R, L, Ground, which means that if you buy a 3-band connector on ebay, or say for a samsung or motorola, it will work, but your stereo imaging will be reversed. I made that mistake the first time. I plugged in my $15 Koss THE Plug earbuds and they sound pretty decent for a cell phone, on par with my Creative Muvo Mp3 player.Cons to these- the cords are an awkward length, and either my phone or this headset adds some kind of weird 3D reverb effect to the audio, not sure on that one yet.Overall, I think these are the best option if you have a stereo MP3-playing LG phone right now.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2007", "summary": "does exactly what i wanted"}

I was concerned about the keypad size and though it is smaller than the Razr's, I haven't had a problem with it. I like that it has a little heft to it since it's so small. It makes it feel more substantial. It is solid. I've accidently dropped it pretty hard a  couple of times and there's been no damage that I can ascertain.The screen gets smudged a lot, but it is easy to clean. It's bright, large and clear.The menus are fairly easy to master in one sitting, even if they can seem a bit illogical at first after you've gotten used to the menus of another phone. It does offer a number of ways to one touch access the menus you want without any drill down or search.It's small enough that I don't require a holder. I just slip it in the watch pocket of my jeans.Even with the 100 song limit I like the iTunes and I love being able to use any MP3 for a ringtone. I can't imagine why anyone would need to purchase ringtones for this phone.The software that comes with the phone is very useful and easy to use. I had to download a free utility to cut out the ringtone from my mp3's.I don't think I've ever had a dropped call but getting a signal outside of major metropolitan areas can be a problem. Also being inside large buildings like Walmart, a church, or a mall makes getting a signal difficult.The sound quality is excellent. Battery life is excellent.Camera is OK and viewer quality is very good.This camera is quite hackable which gives the user a lot more options.My original bill from Cingular was incorrect, but it was corrected quickly and there haven't any unexpected charges. There hasn't been any $18 charge for using Amazon or anything like that.This phone is easy to sync with iTunes or with folders on a PC.I personally like the USB cable and charger that came free with the phone. They are free and they work.The headset earpieces are very uncomfortable and although an adapter to allow the use of other headphones came free with the phone it eliminates the ablility to answer, disconnect or communicate using your own headphones. The supplied headphones have a built in microphone and do allow you to dial out and answer calls using them. It pauses the iTunes during calls and then resumes them. Also, Blue Tooth headphones can only be used with the phone, not the iTunes- seems a little too expensive for such limited usage.It would be nice to use the charger and the headset at the same time, but they use the same jack in the phone.Sound quality is good. Speaker phone is good. The sound isn't effected by ambient noise. If my wife is with me she uses my phone instead of her Razr because she says she can hear much better on mine.The one button speed dial and the voice dial both work great and make it safer to use, if absolutely necessary, in the car.Autofill feature in the phone book and texting is helpful.The manual should have been written by someone for whom English is their first language.As far as using your old phone number: If that's important to you then don't get a phone through Amazon. If you try to change it after the fact you're gonna get hit with some hefty charges. I find, however, that after 2 years I start getting calls on my cell from people I don't know. It took 5 minutes to send my new number to the people I want to have my cell phone number. Of course, that's because I don't rely exclusively on my mobile. I give most people my land line number- that's just my preference though.I hope this covers most people's concerns about this phone. I like it and I'm glad I chose it.

All I've ever wanted is a simple-to-use, reliable, SMALL phone that I could easily carry around.  I have no use for internet features, IM/texting or a camera in a phone... which is probably a good thing as far as this review goes.Cons:1.) The camera is grainy and extremely limited in function.  If you snap alot of pics with your phone, this isn't the one for you.2.)  My first battery wouldn't hold a charge for even one day.  The second one lasts much longer, but still not as long as advertised on the box.3.)  My phone came pre-loaded with only melody and sound effect ringtones, no \"regular\" tones that sounded like a phone ringing.4.)  I gave up waiting on the internet to log on, so I can't even comment on it's functionality.Pros:1.)  It's freaking tiny.  As a guy who likes to carry his phone in a pocket rather than in a belt holster, this phone is the perfect size.  I hardly even know it's there.2.)  Signal strength is great.  I have no problem hearing calls, nor does anyone have a problem hearing me.3.)  The interface is really really easy to navigate though you'll have some problems if you got big fingers.So all in all, I'm satisfied with the Pantech C300 because it does the very basic things I need from a cellphone very well, in a very small package.

You have press two buttons to put the phone on speaker phone and if you have dialed any numbers during the call you have to clear them out and then press two buttons to put it on speaker phone.  If you don't clear out the numbers it flashes over and tries to dial the numbers on the other line.My other big grip with this phone is that it doesn't delete old text messages when new ones come in.  Instead it says your inbox(or outbox) is full and you have to delete the oldest messages one by one or you can delete all messages.  There is no setting to have it automatically delete old messages and that is a pain.I like to color screen on the outside on the phone so you can see who is calling and that you can set personal ringtones for each caller.  You can also assign a picture to a caller.  The only problem is that it can't be a picture that someone sent you from there phone, it has to be one that you took on the camera.  This is very strange since they are both jpg's and both taken on camera phones.  Pictures that are sent to you are stored in a different place than pictures that you take with the camera phone.  They should be stored in the same place.  Conversely you can set the wallpaper background picture to either type of picture.Ringtones and Games - The ringtones that come on the phone suck.  I know this is because they want you to buy rinetones but they should at least have one ringtone that sounds like something ringing.  The phone only came with one game, again because they want you to buy them.I have used the wireless web to read news and sports scores and it works fine.  You have to scroll allot because of the size of the screen but that's ok if you want a small phone.No bluetooth but I'm not a fan of looking like a cyborg any way.The small size of the phone is one of it's best selling points but it should be pointed out that the small keys make it a little more difficult when sending text messages.  If you send more than 2 text messages a day you should consider getting a different phone.  The keys need to be more like the old Motorola Vader.Even with all the things I would change about this phone I still recommend it over the competition.

Back and forth e-mails to BargainCell, two long distance telephone calls, about an hour on the telephone, with them telling me that this 'charging kit' is compatible with both Tungsten and Treo models.Well is 'not'... The cable will initiate a 'sync' when the button is pressed, but it will not charge the E2. Tested it myself, compared it to an original Palm cable and noticed that the cable from BargainCell has about half the number of pins in the connector base to connect to the Palm. No doubt missing the ones that provide the 'charging'!Kind-of makes the USB car adapter and the wall adapter like totally 'useless', unless someone wants to try and sync their palm to their car, or home!Looking around the Internet I see many similar products, all claiming to be compatible with both the Tungsten and the Treo.After this experience, with BargainCell still claiming that these cables are compatible with both models, now I have to question 'all' other such listings, making the same claim!Paying nearly as much for shipping as the item itself, BargainCell expected me to send this back for a refund! No doubt not refunding 'my' shipping expenses back to them, and deducting the shipping expenses I already paid to have this sent to me! Needless to say, a loosing proposition either way to me.Either go through all that trouble and expense for what would be a 'couple dollar' refund, or keep the USB auto and wall charger and toss the cable in the garbage.With numerous other listing all making the same claim as to 'compatibility', I think I'll save my time and aggravation and just spend the $20.00 and get an original from Palm!Had similar experiences with other 'so-called' compatible imported products, dumped on the market cheaply. No more for me! I'll spend the extra and get original OEM products, and probably in the long run, actually save money, not having to deal with time lost on e-mails and telephone calls, after incompatibly issues are discovered, and companies not bothering to do proper research! And what really gets me, is with something so 'simple'!BargainCell is most likely just a reseller of imported goods, taking the word of the importer as 'gospel', and not listening to a customer when they are called telling them that 'Hey... this doesn't work'!Don't know what 'value' others put on their time, but this experience probably wound up costing me more than double the cost of an OEM product!Was this really a 'Bargain'?", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2008", "summary": "'Compatible'...

Immediately I noticed it wasn't closing properly.  The flap wouldn't fold down.  It turns out the two tiny magnets sewn into the flap weren't glued into their settings.  The magnets would fall out and float around inside the flap.  Without them, the flap would not stay closed.  If they floated to the bend / crease at the top of the case, the flap would stay open all the way.  I couldn't return it because I was on the road, so to keep my phone from falling out of the case, I actually had to remove some of the stitching at the bottom lip of the flap and carefully glue the magnets in place.  I then restitched the flap.About two months after that, the elastic webbing on the side of the case completely gave way, leaving the entire side of the case wide open.  It was nowhere near where I \"fixed\" the magnets, so it wasn't my repair that caused the elastic to give way. I also never put anything in it other than my iPhone, so it was never stretched beyond its intended purpose.The case is garbage.  It didn't work properly from day 1 and became completely useless within 3 months.  I could have made a better case out of duct tape.Save your money and buy something from a company that pays attention to those little details like magnets that stay in place and elastic that lasts more than 3 months.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011", "summary": "shoddy in every aspect"}

I had a co-worker recommend this one and decided to give it a try.  - Glad I did.  The metal plate attaches firmly to the back of your phone/phone case via the manufacturer applied adhesive - just peel & stick.  For mounting the holder to the dash, I used 3M duo lock (similar to velcro, but stronger) and applied one piece to the back of the holder and other pieces to a couple different mounting locations on my dash - as well as one in my wife's car.  That way, it can be moved to wherever desired.  - Works great and holds strong.  The adjustable swivel of the holder seems to hold strong in whatever position/angle it is placed, despite the weight of a smart phone.  (Hoping this will continue over time, but so far, so good after a few weeks.)  Many phone holders seem to 'clamp' on to the phone from two or three sides and would look to somewhat obstruct view of the screen, but this holder provides great screen and button access. - Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2011", "summary": "Small, versatile, and works well"}

The streaming is interrupted once or twice every minute, each time for half a second to two seconds. This problem doesn't occur--or hasn't occurred--when I am near the source or in clear line of sight (\"Bluetooth doesn't need line-of-sight, dummy!\" yes dear, I heard you).(Addendum: 9 Apr. 2007) Because LG uses its proprietary connector to connect the Bluetooth reciever and the headphone, it's possible to get a LG connector adaptor and use the Bluetooth reciever with your favorite headphone.

Even the side buttons work fine through the clear plastic. The mini SD card slot, USB port, charger and headset jacks are all uncovered and easily accessible.Unfortunately the belt clip had a hairline crack and broke entirely in less than a day.

(1) It fits the W300i like a glove; (2) I love being able release the phone from the clip with the push of a button; (3) I like that it has a ratcheting mechanism (for lack of a better term) that keeps the phone from swinging freely in the clip and allows you to position the phone vertically or horizontally (or any number of positions) when attached to the clip; and (4) It attaches tightly to your belt or pants waistband.  The clip will cause the phone to extend a little less than an inch from your body, and I have caught the phone on doorways, etc., but the alternatives don't provide a tough case to protect the phone.  And it IS a tough case.  I've probably dropped the phone somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 times this year -- usually from around waist-level onto asphalt and concrete.  The phone's functionality has never been affected and the only damage to the phone has been small nicks near the infrared sensor and stop/volume button, near the top of the phone -- areas not covered by the case.I have only a couple of minor complaints about the case.  First, the plastic on the top of the clip nearest the phone (that also contains the release mechanism) broke off after about 8 months.  However, I am partly to blame as I was using the phone's Walkman function as I jogged daily.  Each day I would squeeze the top of the clip to open it as wide as possible so that if would fit over the thick waistband of my shorts.  Eventually, it broke, leaving me without the ability to remove the phone from the clip.  If you can envision the clip as a spring-loaded clothspin, I was squeezing the top of the clothespin.  I believe that if I would have instead pried apart the bottom of the clip when attaching the clip to this one pair of shorts, the plastic never would have broken.  By the way, I can jog with this case clipped on and neither the clip nor the phone are in any danger of dislodging.  That's a big plus, as I've had other belt clips that would allow the phone to pop out of the clip just by simply bending over.The second minor complaint is that after a year the case's skin has cracked near the top (one of the two narrow sections connecting the back of the case to the front of the case.  The stitching has not unraveled anywhere around the case.So, is it perfect?  No.  But the pros of this case/clip combo far outweigh the cons.  Too me, it's the best choice for the W300i, and at $13 (I paid $18 a year ago) Amazon's the place to buy it.  (In fact, I just ordered another as a replacement.)UPDATE: After three months of using case #2, the ratcheting mechanism has failed, so the phone rotates freely in the clip.  The result is that the phone often ends up upside down and flips open.  Would reduce my rating to 2 stars, if I could.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2007", "summary": "Best case for the Sony Ericsson W300i, but not perfect"}

I had been obsessing over this phone for months when it was finally time to upgrade I was delighted with the phone but couldnt help but feel a bit worried that some harm would befall my phone due to my lifestyle. I purchased this skin to keep my phone safe from damage and to free my hands when i had more important matters to tend such as my baby work groceries whatever that would tie my hands. I have to say i was very suprised at how this skin grows on you and has done a wonderful job protecting my phone from whatever dangers may be out there i.e. my one year old daughter throwing it against the pavement outside. So far no harm has come to my phone and I know the skin has played a big part in this. The case has a snap button on the backside of it so its really a two piece it easily snaps back on once u have the case on the phone or vice versa theres not problem removeing the case or being able to quickly reapply if necessary. Not to mention its not really that expensive compared to what i have seen. It fits my phone perfectly and easily swivels free from the belt clip for easy access if ur on the go.

This buffer protects the lens, and was a very important feature to me.  All of the cut-outs for battery re-charging, music download with USB cable, turning the phone on and off: They are totally, correctly placed. A clear, thin material covers the LCD screen, and the shortcut, toggle, and number buttons. The clear cover is so strong I use a PDA stylus to store info quickly. But, it's so flexible I can dial a number with my fingers. I guess, in time, the clear cover might seperate from the black foam-rubberized material; that's why I bought two of these at the same time. The fit is very snug SO don't jam the phone into the case. The directions tell you to allow the case a few days to stretch a tiny bit.  The snug fit keeps out dust and sand. I also like the snap closure which keeps the phone inside the case; no 'phone-falls-out-of-case-again' disaster. * I can't imagine the force it would take to rip the clip in the back of the case out of the material it is embedded in; I pulled on the clip rather energetically and the clip did not move at all. (Cell phones should not be taken into some places, clipped to a belt.) This case really protects the LCD screen, all the keys, and prevents the camera lens from coming into direct contact with dried ketchup on a table top, etc. The case is not rainproof.

I carry a lot of \"stuff\" in my pockets and was afraid some of it would scratch up my phone.This case has a very secure belt clip that rotates so you can wear the case vertically or horizontally.  I find I like horizontally best because it does not interfere with bending at the waist this way - something I do a lot of.  It uses a powerful magnet closure rather than a snap or velcro.  This works very well and is easy to get into when I need to get my phone, but holds well otherwise. The magnets have not affected the performance of my phone - I was concerned about placing powerful magnets so near a piece of electronics with a magnetic memory card inside.My only complaint was that the case is a bit narrow for a standard flip phone and it was quite difficult to get the phone in the first time or two.  Also, my phone has side buttons that adjust volume, activate the camera and such.  Sliding the phone in and out of the case tends to mash on those buttons and change things.  However, I found that after wearing the phone clipped to my belt and under my sweatshirt for a few days, the case molded itself to the phone rather well.  It's still a snug fit, but not hard to get the phone in and out.  Also, I found a setting on my phone that locks the side buttons once the phone is flipped closed.  This effectively prevents changing my settings.Overall I'm quite happy with the case, it is secure, versatile and comfortable; once it gets worked in.

He had been looking for a case that would keep his smallish flip phone out of his pocket.Considering its price, the case was very well-crafted, and the rich brown leather has a great smell coming out of the packaging. The clip, which holds the case to the belt or waistband, rotates so that it can be worn up-down or sideways on the body.  Depending on whether he is sitting and standing, a guy may want to be able to adjust which way the phone is sitting on his hip, and this clip was sturdy and clicked into place at 45-degree angles.The case was a great size for the clam-style flip phone, and I believe it would probably been big enough that one of the new ultra-thin phones would have bounced around without leaving the foam padding piece in.The fastening is a very strong magnet - you know it's going to stay in place unless you want to open the case.  Once you get a finger underneath and give a tug, however, it opens smoothly. No snaps or zippers or other two-piece fasteners to deal with, and less problems for a closure-failure.I would have given it 5 stars, as it is a really nice little case, but the leather scratched when I was moving the belt clip around and testing it, leading me to think that the leather itself might be too soft to remain \"business wear,\" and would be soon relegated to \"casual wear,\" like a worn-in pair of soft loafers - thus limiting its possibilities.I'd definitely buy another!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2010", "summary": "Stylish men's accessory"}

There was not much out there. From the measurements of this I found online, I thought it might work. So, for $20, I decided to give it a shot. The case was here the day before the phone came out. When I got the EVO, it fit right in nice and snug. Note that the case does have open corners, so I would advise using an Innocase or Otterbox style case with this to protect the phone. I would also suggest facing the phone inward. Overall, the case is very well made and will hold up as well as other cases like this I have had before. The magnetic closure is actually very nice. I was not sure about this when I ordered it, however I have been very pleased with it and it stays closed nicely. There is also a nice pocket inside the case on the belt side that is perfect for a spare battery. Those of you with an EVO who use it heavily, like me, will have use for that. This is not a small case, but if you are looking for this style of case, you know that already. Overall, great case holster combo.Update on May 25, 2012This case has held up nicely over the last two years. We upgraded our phones to the HTC Evo 4G LTE  by Sprint. I was concerned that the new phone would not fit into this holster since it is slightly larger. It still fits nicely (in a Seidio Active case). It still has that area for an extra battery. Since the HTC Evo 4G LTE does not have a user replaceable battery, I am planning on getting an external battery which, as long as I don't get a huge one, there will be plenty of room for. They make some that are the same size as or slightly larger than the original Evo's battery.Another update - June 17, 2012When I purchased an external battery for my phone (HTC Evo 4G LTE), it does fit in the case. It does, however, fit VERY tightly and it is difficult to get the phone in and out of the case. Without the external battery with the phone in the Seidio Active case, it fits beautifully. The external battery is slightly larger than my old Evo's extra battery.(The HTC \"regular\" Evo 4G in a Seidio case - my old phone - with an extra battery fit well.) I will probably hang onto this case for a while longer as it is well made - it outlived one phone so far and is still in great shape, but I will be shopping for another case. This is still a great case if you don't live on your phone when you are away from your desk - so you don't need an extra external battery. This case will still continue to work well with the HTC Evo 4G LTE even in the Seidio Active case.I continue to recommend a case that protects the corners of your phone like the Seidio or the Otterbox cases.

To be able to have cellphone conversations while driving down the road, without holding one's phone, without a stupid headset, rather just talking naturally, with the other person's voice coming out crisp and clean through the car stereo speakers.  Beautiful.And maybe that's what it's like, if you have a car with a properly integrated bluetooth system.  If you don't, there's the Scosche DIYBRH.  You plug it into your cigarette lighter plug, and into your audio system's auxiliary input, and you're good to go.  Its microphone picks up your voice, and trasmits the whole conversation through the speakers.  A bargain at $90 or so.  Right?Wrong.  This product should never have been released into the market.  It is a total piece of junk.  Sound quality is absolutely awful.  The microphone barely works.  Worst of all, the lighter plug is so badly designed that the slightest bump causes the whole unit to turn off, instantly breaking the connection and shutting off the call.  And every time that happens, you have to go through a complex process of re-syncing it with your cellphone, because it has no memory or backup battery for connections whatsoever.  What it adds up to is, this ended up being an absolutely worthless piece of cheap plastic.

I own aApple 60 GB Black iPod Video AAC/MP3 Player (5th Generation)and the Motorola Krzr K1m Sprint phone, which sadly does not feature stereo bluetooth and I was looking for a solution for this unnecessary issue (Motorola should've built in stereo bluetooth along with it's mp3 player). The Scosche Blulife Home Kit was the answer to my prayer. Not only could I use the transmitter with my phone to send stereo audio to my bluetooth headset, the reciever can be used for sound in the home or vehicle. A beautiful thing.For my video Ipod, I can connect the standard 3.5\" jack and send the signal to either the receiver, which connects via any RCA connection, or to mySony Ericsson Bluetooth Headset HBH-DS970. One important thing to point out is to know what you want to do with your devices, then, read the manuals for all your devices thoroughly. I admit I did have trouble the first time around with the HBH-DS970 pairing to the transmitter and the phone simultaneously, but once I spent time with the manual, I followed the clear instructions and was able to achieve my goal of being able to switch back and forth between music and phone calls. It s all about the single/multiple switch button on the headset. The only gripe I have if  any, is the size of the transmitter, which could get bulky if you intend to connect it to your portable devices on the go. Otherwise indoor use not a problem whatsoever.Here's The Breakdown:Pros: Fast automatic pairingNo compatibility issuesUser FriendlyDurableComes with various size holsters for the different Ipod typesPrice - very affordable and appropriateBattery LifeMake your non bluetooth phone (or other device) into a bluetooth  phone (or other device)Cons: Transmitter a bit bulky for use with phone adds bulk to IpodHighly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2007", "summary": "Bluetooth Heaven!"}

For me this device sits by itself most of the time on a shelf as I don't need it.  If I had then my review would have dropped a star.The main point for me was the receiver for the stereo.  This device has worked flawlesly.  I have paired it with computers and palm devices on the fly to play sounds and music.  It took some time to find a slot it would work on with my 1980's era receiver, but once found it's been great.The only other note I have is that the power adaptors for the transmitter and receiver are remarkably similar but not interchangeable.  Be careful about this.All in all for the low $20's price tag I paid, this has been a great purchase to adapt my stereo to playing from my blue tooth devices.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2008", "summary": "Great for the price point"}

I have a thin CaseLogic cover on my iPhone 3GS, and the charger plug would not fully insert in the phone.  It would stay loosely in the phone and would charge as long as you did not move the phone, or otherwise the plug would slide out of position.  My daughter has a thicker phone cover and the plug would not insert at all without removing the phone cover first.Second problem: The adapter I received is not the same as the one shown in the picture, which looks sturdier.  The ones I received break easily.  Of the three, only one is still working.  One just stopped working.  The second one broke when being pulled out of a wall socket.  The wall plug portion of the charger can be flipped in and out of the charger, and it appears the hinge inside the charger is flimsy.  It broke when we removed it from the wall socket and I could no longer fully flip the plug out of the charger to plug back into the wall.You get what you pay for.Only one works now and we're planning to toss it once our order for theBelkin Rotating Charger for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 & iPod F8Z418bNLarrives.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2011", "summary": "Not as great as many have reviewed..."}

Suddenly, my phone began acting up -- the battery would die so quickly it would turn off before it even gave the low battery warning light.  Sometimes it would go directly from 3 bars of battery life to unable to turn on.Even keeping it plugged in to the car charger it would turn off after a 20 minute conversation, and be unable to turn back on until it had charged for a while.I brought the phone in to an AT&T; wireless store hoping that the salesperson would agree with me that it was most likely a battery problem, and that I could buy a new one and fix the whole problem.  Unfortunately, the salesguy said that they did not carry the batteries for this phone anymore, but that I could get them from AT&T; online.  He also warned me that the symptoms I was describing could mean that my phone was on its last legs, and that I would need to replace it.I went online, but even on the website, AT&T; no longer carried any accessories or batteries for my phone.  Luckily I found this battery for sale here, and although I was nervous about purchasing a battery from an unknown merchant.  The price was better than I ever imagined it would have been, so I decided it was worth the risk for such a low price.When it arrived, it was already half-charged, and I went through the standard charging routine of fully charging, fully discharging several times.  Since getting this battery my phone has stopped all of its foolishness, and seems to be as good as new.  Possibly even better.  Maybe it is wishful thinking, but it seems that the reception has even improved since getting this battery!My only complaint was that I wanted to order a replacement stylus, and I noticed that this same company sold them.  Even though they weigh practically nothing and would be shipped from the same company along with the battery to the same place, they doubled the shipping cost.

This is a molded one-piece unit - there is no \"closure\" to hook after inserting the phone. Instead, the silicon is surprisingly stretchy; you can actually wrap it around the phone using any of a few of the openings and just stretching from there. And once on, the silicon holds quite well - \"skin\" is an accurate term.As for the look and feel; the desireablility of these is obviously quite subjective. I do like the powdery sort of tactile experience - the case is neither slick nor smooth, but, for lack of a better term, feels a little like very finely sanded and polished wood. I'm not a great fan of the look per se, but that's rather low on my list of important features for as utilitarian an item as this.I would have given it 5 stars, except for the disapointing fact that the belt clip is just shoddy. Theere is a threaded tap in the center back of the silicon case, and a provided screw is placed there. The head of this short screw is flared enough to hold the beltclip mechanism. Two problems here, though - first, the screw tends to loosen (they actually provide a spare with the case, but that just shows how the manufacturer is aware of the problem). Second, the belt clip itself has a cheap feel to it - much lower quality than the beltclips I have from other phone cases. Naturally, though, the other clips don't work with this slightly different screw-head design, so I can't use them.My solution, then was to remove the screw and not use the clip part at all - rather, I purchased yet another case, this one a leather belt model with a flap over the top from ItzKitz. The Treo fits quite nicely in the case while wrapped in the skin. So now I have a belt unit that won't come off accidentally (the belt clasp is integral on the leather case) with a protected Treo inside.Works for me, but of course for something like this it's a personal call to decide if it will work for you.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007", "summary": "Nice case, bad clip"}

Not only would you catch the top of your finger on it's needle-like tip every time you went to unclasp it from your belt, but it started to work its way free in the two days I kept it. Not a good thing if you desire to keep your hinge together.If that wasn't bad enough, sections of the inside were bent far beyond where they should have, thus covering the all-important \"Alt\" key on the keyboard.  This, as all Blackberry users know, makes it pretty difficult to construct a message! The meatal was so strong, it couldn't be bent back out of the way (a good thing if you dropped it!).Like the other poster said, the clasp to keep it latched shut was also VERY weak.  So weak that all it took was a slight push and it would come undone and the B'berry would come out.While the almost rock-solid casing is a great thing, I'm afraid I had to return my metal case and get an old fashioned leather padded one.

Quite honestly, I have yet to see any other case that compares with this one in terms of protection.I've used soft cases before - on my Nokia cell phone - and found them to be mediocre at best.  Corners are left exposed and if you drop your phone from a height of more than two feet you've likely scratched or damaged your phone.  Many of the other hard cases for Blackberry tend to be the slip in and out kind.  You take the phone out and it's not protected.  Problem is, when you go to make that call or send that message that's exactly the time you might drop your phone.  If that ever happens to you, this is the case you'll want for your Blackberry.Perhaps the biggest misconception about this case is the description of \"aluminum\" and \"metal.\"  Buyers will think hard, and heavy with sharp edges.  Not so at all.  This is lightweight aircraft aluminum that feels almost like plastic.  There are no sharp edges.  Inside there's a thin layer of dense foam-like material that separates the Blackberry from the metal.  The screen is protectived by a thin form of plexiglass.  Unfortunately, this glass needs a screen protector as it does get scratched.  The keyboard space is open which seems the only choice given how dense the keypad is and how difficult it would be to use it with any kind of protective plastic cover.I only have a couple of small complaints.  One, I wish the clasp on the left side was more secure.  I have dropped my phone once already and the case did flip open because of this.  Two, I wish there was more protection on the top side.  Also, to a lesser degree, I wish there was more open space on the right side so that it was easier to access the scroll wheel.The case comes with a belt clip.  You can also just use the case by itself without the clip attachment and slip it into a soft case or your pocket.Overall, while it's a bit pricey for a small case, it's worth the extra money over the typical soft models that offer only the appearance of protection for your expensive Blackberry.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2006", "summary": "Lightweight and versatile with minor flaws"}

Perhaps it is the area I am in (north Jersey), but I sure can tell I'm on a cell phone!  While better than my previous model, I'm still saying \"what? could you repeat that?\"  In calling Verizon Wireless to ask another question, the technical supervisor just told me \"the voice quality and even reception ability varies a lot from individual phone to phone within every model: we can get 5 phones of the same model and line them up and each one sounds different and right next to each other they'll display different signal strengths...\"  Wish I'd known THAT before I bought!I like this phone's features, and since Verizon has it on promotion, it's a great deal right now.  It has more \"conveniences\" than I'll really use.  It doesn't have bluetooth for hands-free, but that's OK with me.My biggest complaint is that the LED display (it's not an LCD but new LED display) is completely unreadable in daylight.  Also you must use some kind of cover: the battery comes unclipped with the slightest of touches on the clasp such as pulling the phone out of a pocket or purse.

The reception is excellent, which to me is the most important feature.  The phone does have an extendable antenna, which might seem out-of-style, but reception remained quite good without extension.The camera is very average, but as far as I am concerned, the phone camera is just for taking quick pictures to show your friends where you are, something funny, etc.  If I want something I can print and frame, I'll still use my regular camera.  There is a flash, which has come in handy.The most unique part of the phone, however, is the screen.  Though small, the screens are made with new OLED technology, which is extremely bright with terrific contrast in average lighting.  On a traditional LCD screen, there is a large backlight that sends light through every pixel, and each pixel is like a little nightshade.  To make a dark point, the screen pulls the nightshade to block as much of the backlight as possible.  But the pixels can't block 100% of the light; a little bit always leaks through, especially if you look from other angles.  A good analogy is a window blind -- never perfect at blocking all of the sun, and if you look at it from different angles, you get more or less light through.On an OLED screen, each pixel is like a tiny little light bulb, which can turn on and off independently of one another.  When they are off, they are completely off, which gives the screen its amazing contrast.  It also looks identically sharp regardless of your viewing angle.Unfortunately, it is COMPLETELY invisible in bright sunlight, even more so than most cellphone screens.  This is also because of the fact that each pixel generates light directly rather than blocking it.  Even though the light generated by an OLED is impressive, it is no match for the sun, and gets washed out completely.  On the other hand, since an LCD works by blocking light, it is still able to block some of the sunlight to form a visible image, even if it was designed to be illuminated from the back.  The nightshade/light bulb analogy is again appropriate.  In a sunlit room, turning on a light bulb makes a lot less difference compared to pulling the blinds.  So, the OLED is a bit of a double-edged sword.My only other significant quibble is the low memory capacity, with no ability for expansion.  4 MB is just not very much; you won't be able to keep too many pictures or ringtones.Overall, the phone is quite good.  It is small and light, and looks rather sleek.  Most importantly, it makes crystal clear calls with no drops that I can remember.

At least the black one, that's the one I got... I dunno about the pink one! I've been using it for a month now and it does a great job protecting my cell phone from scratches, both on the outside and on the screen on the inside. I encountered one problem though: the case in general is very tight, which is ok because it gives you a firm grip. However it is missing holes for the side buttons, so the tightness of the case made it so that the side buttons were pressed every time I opened the phone. I actually had to pull on the plastic part to losen it up a bit and give more space to the buttons. My phone is a SGH D407. I don't know if there are different versions of the same model that have the side buttons in a different place. I suggest you check your phone before buying it.
